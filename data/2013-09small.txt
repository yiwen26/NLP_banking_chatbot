I'd eat one waffle normally (so 1 unit of syrup for it) and then discard the remaining syrup because I don't like either less or extra syrup, and I have no use for .5 of a serving of syrup. newlinechar  newlinechar 'But what about the second waffle' you say, doubting my waffle/topping distribution skill.  newlinechar  newlinechar I use jam on the second waffle.

I'm just sick of every post here being 'My take on...' , 'What I think of the -- Storyline...'. I feel like this reddit should be about the discussion of news and storylines going on, not everyone circle jerking saying 'With Cena gone, people sure are going to step up and we will see who does well' Obviously, this isn't adding anything to any discussion. It's not thoughtful or insightful. Sorry to go off on you, it is not personal.

You sound like a caring and concerned friend. In all honesty, it's not your place to help Russ, he may have to seek help from professionals. Just remember the reason why you didn't want to keep in touch with him after high school - you aren't like-minded and he has ulterior motives. Keep a good crowd of people around you, that's all you really need.	I just know that if he didn't tell his parents or anyone else, he only told me. I feel like he sees me as the only person to reach out to. I agree, he does need professional help, but I'm not sure if he'd seek it out. He has a lot of pride, really too much. I think I just have to let go and hope he can turn around once he's let out of jail. And thanks for taking the time to read this and give your advice, I really do appreciate it.
Krylov didn't break his rib, he said he did it before the fight, and i thought he did pretty well considering there was 265 pound beast on him and still got a few shots off, escapes and submission attempts for a good 6 minutes and your guaranteed to be tired after that.	Yeah, I posted that before he said that. It looked like he broke his rib with those knees in the first, turns out he knee'd an already injured rib.  newlinechar  newlinechar Just all around awful fight iq from Krylov. Soa started wilting as soon as he was hitting those knees to the body in the first. Probably should've been aware of that. Then he keeps trying to grapple with this guy that is 30+ pounds bigger than him. Then at the end of the 2nd he has him up against the cage with Soa covering his head, so what does he do? Throw a bunch of shots to the head. All he had to was land one or two shots to Soa's undefended body and he would've dropped.

Police tend to view people wearing bulky clothing as being potentially armored, you have no idea what they have on under that.

Namaskar! newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This believe is not mistaken, it is accurate, at least in the case of any religion I'm familiar with (mainly the Abrahamic religions). newlinechar  newlinechar I'm a former Christian pastor who also studied for ~3 years for conversion to Orthodox Judaism before, eventually, becoming Hindu. With respect, I can assure you that the purpose of Judaism and Christianity is *not* to present an explanation on where the Universe came from. For example, a cursory reading of Genesis will demonstrate that barely any information is actually present, especially that information that can be tested. Human beings *love* testing things, if origin was the point then why isn't there more information explaining *exactly* how it happened? Because the point of the creation myth is to express that the creation *came from God* and no one else. Especially in the lands and time of ancient Judaism, where there were many competing ideologies. It was the Hebrew's way of saying 'Nuh uh, guys! Our god did it! It says so right here!'. newlinechar  newlinechar So what is the point of Judaism and Christianity? Well, you've heard it before from them but I'm going to go ahead and reiterate it anyway: *love* and *respect*. Kind of makes what's going on with, at least Christianity, a lot worse than just saying 'God made the Universe in six days,' doesn't it? =( newlinechar  newlinechar I can actually provide proof from their own scriptures that this was the purpose of the religions: newlinechar  newlinechar Deut. 6:5 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And you shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your means. newlinechar  newlinechar R. Hillel newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;âThat which is hateful to you, do not unto another: This is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary â [and now] go study.â newlinechar  newlinechar Matthew 22:36-40 (though not from Judaism's Tanakh, this is a story about a Jewish Rabbi being tested by Jewish Rabbis on the cornerstone of the religion, later adapted for Christianity) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;36 âTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?â 37 Jesus replied: ââLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.â 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: âLove your neighbor as yourself.â 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.â newlinechar  newlinechar So if *the* core commandment, the cornerstone upon which the entire religion is built, is *love* and *respect* then why is that the one thing they most need to work on? Well, I could write a book on that! =D Basically it sums up to human nature. It's easier for me to try to change *you* than it is to try to change *me* and, when I fail, it's easier to persecute *you* while claiming that you're actually trying to persecute *me* than anything else. After all, you're the one really at fault for all the world's ills, not me! (Not really, I like you a lot and I'm sure you're a great guy! =D ) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If this is not the point of religion, then what is the point? newlinechar  newlinechar I touched on this elsewhere in the thread, but I just typed the response so you probably missed it. No worries! You don't mind a copy-pasta do you? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Whatever a person wants it to be, I guess. I would - and have - argue that religion's purpose is to elevate the mundane to the realms of the holy. A classic example of this in Hinduism: the lotus. The lotus grows in the muck and mud beneath the water's surface, but through patience and diligent obeisance the lotus breaks free of the confines of the slime and even the water's surface to blossom in the light of the warm sun and breath the free air. newlinechar  newlinechar So does this mean *you* need religion? If you think it'll help! Otherwise *you* know you better than anyone and I'm sure you're doing a great job at being the best you you can be! Keep up the good work! =D	&gt; I'm a former Christian pastor who also studied for ~3 years for conversion to Orthodox Judaism before, eventually, becoming Hindu. With respect, I can assure you that the purpose of Judaism and Christianity is not to present an explanation on where the Universe came from. For example, a cursory reading of Genesis will demonstrate that barely any information is actually present, especially that information that can be tested newlinechar  newlinechar So, genesis does not tell the story of how god created the universe?  What was it about? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So what is the point of Judaism and Christianity? Well, you've heard it before from them but I'm going to go ahead and reiterate it anyway: love and respect. Kind of makes what's going on with, at least Christianity, a lot worse than just saying 'God made the Universe in six days,' doesn't it? =( newlinechar  newlinechar So why are there so many examples of barbarism in the bible?  Things that any sane person would consider completely immoral today? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So if the core commandment, the cornerstone upon which the entire religion is built, is love and respect then why is that the one thing they most need to work on? Well, I could write a book on that! =D Basically it sums up to human nature. It's easier for me to try to change you than it is to try to change me and, when I fail, it's easier to persecute you while claiming that you're actually trying to persecute me than anything else. After all, you're the one really at fault for all the world's ills, not me! (Not really, I like you a lot and I'm sure you're a great guy! =D ) newlinechar  newlinechar That's a laudable philosophy, my question is: why would a moral person require the threat of eternal damnation by an all-powerful creator to be moral?  Religion seems to be a way to scare people into the kind of moral behavior that atheists exhibit without any mythical threat. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So does this mean you need religion? If you think it'll help! Otherwise you know you better than anyone and I'm sure you're doing a great job at being the best you you can be! Keep up the good work! =D newlinechar  newlinechar So do you think that people should believe something simply because it will have a good outcome if they believe it?  I think you should only believe something if there is evidence that it is true, regardless of the consequences.

They aren't exactly in the right here either, but as the poster who is asking for advice it is best just to ignore the hate. Look at it, disagree and move on. I'm glad my advice could help though!
~3 years ago in Nampa someone ran a stop sign and hit my car (no one was hurt). When the officer was filling out paperwork and getting proof of insurance and what not, I realized I didn't put my new insurance card in the car, so I only had the old one. I pulled up my insurance via the USAA App on my phone and she was able to use that.  newlinechar I cannot confirm this works for a traffic stop for speeding or something, but one would think that an auto accident would be more strict in regards to proof of insurance, so I would assume it would be fine. 	A quick note though, I can't say I would be entirely comfortable handing  over my phone in an unlocked state to someone I don't know. I don't have anything to hide, but that doesn't mean I want someone snooping through my phone/pictures. With the traffic accident, she simply sat there and wrote down the details while I held the phone up. A traffic stop would likely result in them taking your phone back to their car to input all the info

People are making macros to do it anyway, this just makes life easier for those who do not know how to create a macro. If SE would implement a regular queue system, this wouldn't be necessary at all. Plus, the people who aren't using macros, are still spamming the '0' key until they get in anyway, this just allows it so they can do something more productive while they wait.	Right, I understand that.  My point is, my odds of actually being able to log in go up if other people instead go and do other things instead of using your tool.  But if everyone is using tools like this, their odds of getting in don't go up, they go down, because the login request buffer exceeds capacity with a greater frequency.  The only way your tool helps is if it is providing a unique advantage to the user. newlinechar  newlinechar For more details, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons

&gt; I think, personally, that free health care should exist in the case of accidents or unfortunate circumstances. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, but what about accidents caused by someone's stupidity or that otherwise could have been prevented? Should those people have to pay in full as well? After all, an awful lot of accidents of various types happen because people are either ignoring warnings or otherwise just being dumb.	Yeah I know, it's a difficult system full of huge holes. Basically, any injuries caused by every day day to day kind of stuff, or excersize, would be covered, but only the things that everyone KNOWS is bad for you, such as smoking, drunk driving, drugs, obesity, would be on you. It's not a practical system, I agree, but would be perfect if someone could make it work.

No doubt I'm beyond lucky my husband is understanding of my love of make up. I know I look at the mac stuff or even the Naked palette and im like....so shiny....so pretty...so pricey.

Awh my mom is clueless she can't even apply liner (or let me or my sister's do it) she keeps scrunching up her lids. She's a makeup artist's worst nightmare. But she does have a major soft spot for me (seen as I'm the baby) which does help my stash. But I agree, paying for your own stuff kills.

Your dad sounds amazing. I mean, I don't know why they let your uncles come over to harass you to begin with, but it sounds like he figured out what to do pretty quickly. And this is way better than a lot of parents. 	I'm at university now and a lot of my friends are from non-religious backgrounds and have little sympathy for my parents which I can understand in a way. But I would have been totally lost without my Dad. He was taking a backseat in it all because he isn't religious and doesn't have that close family around him like my Mum so I think he felt a bit isolated. But he stepped up when I needed him and it let my Mum do the same. They were a little late to the party but I'm eternally grateful that they showed up
The rubbing fingers together was a play call that they used last year too. Not really a good motion for a play call with the suspicions from the offseason, but it's not meant to be a cocky motion, or taunting the NCAA. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Calling for plays, as has been noted below. The key is that it's communication, not taunting or being cocky.  	He was doing it after successful plays with no players around. Watch the replay. He wasn't play calling. 
I'm kinda late to the conversation but have you heard of GOMAD? (Gallon of milk a day)  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm just starting to read in fittit and I just heard if that before reading this thread.  Has anybody tried that? What do people think since we're on the topic of dairy?	GOMAD works well, but I'd only go all out with a gallon a day if you are seriously under weight.  Most of us only need an extra 200-500 calories extra a day, and should only gain .5-1 pound a week.  Two or three extra glasses a day should be more than enough.
Where are you getting 440k employees from? Are you talking only about the corporate ones here? newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company.html newlinechar  newlinechar McDonald as a whole employs around 1.8mil employees. But McDonald doesn't directly employee all of those people or pay them, the franchisers do. McDonald doesn't incur the labor costs from their individual stores around the world, the franchise owners do. newlinechar  newlinechar They take a cut from each of their 34,000 stores around the world. around 6000 of those stores McDonalds owns outright. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: newlinechar  newlinechar I found something about the stats on average McDonalds stores in America newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.burgerbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/Janney_McD.jpg newlinechar  newlinechar Numbers might not be completely correct, but you can see how much a 50-100% in labor costs could affect it right?  newlinechar  newlinechar McDonalds corporate would probably have to lower their franchise fees they have in the form of rent, etc.. Even then, it would be a big hit. It'll all probably be a wash in the end. newlinechar  newlinechar $15/hr for fast food workers doesn't happen without some kind of government intervention, if that happened prices would simply go up for everything to compensate, or some kind of investment in higher tech.	Your number is worldwide; mine is US (both just approximate--I found other estimates, but they are in the ballpark). So just back-of-envelope, I am assuming they take all their profits worldwide and pay them out to US employees. I know that is a silly assumption--I just was looking for some way to set the profits number and employee number side by side in a way that was intuitively comparable.

What's the purpose of the 'modelling light' in an alienbee strobe? Does this light actually contribute to the exposure?	The purpose of any modeling light is to help you see where and how the shadows/highlights will fall for that light. It also provides light to aid your autofocus system. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as I know, the modeling light doesn't get interrupted for strobing, so it can potentially contribute to the exposure. But that ultimately depends on your exposure settings.

Go watch Star Trek: TNG season 1 finale. Listen to what Picard has to say to the Gordon Gekko surrogate. newlinechar  newlinechar The challenge is to make yourself the best human being possible, not amass as much wealth as you can, and frankly the first task is much harder and more worthy.	I am sorry but I am not really following the connection. I am not saying that we need to amass as much wealth as possible. I am just saying that despite the advances in technology most people still need to work for our society to function. I do agree that people shouldn't be motivated primarily by wealth, but that doesn't mean that they can't work. Some people have taken pay cuts to do something more meaningful and contribute more to society, but they are still in teh labor force.

Any tips for a male thinking about getting into this business? newlinechar  newlinechar I think I'm good enough at writing sex and coming up with variations to be successful at it. But I'm not so sure about fleshing out (so to speak) my female characters in terms of their background and motivation. I am concerned that it will be obvious that it's written by a man. newlinechar  newlinechar I assume writing under a female pseudonym would be best, but does this mean that I need a whole persona for social media? Could I get away with a gender neutral author name? newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for your advice in all the other posts, I've learned a lot from this.	There are no hard rules, really. The worst thing that can happen is that you don't make a ton of sales and you try again.
That's not shadow text. That's whoever made the image typing the same thing twice in two different font sizes to try to mimic it. newlinechar  newlinechar All that needed to be done was to apply a stroke to the text.	I get that, I'm mainly referring to the horrible execution of it.

Im not at all suggesting suppressing thought.  I am saying that every single job this person applies for, the person doing the hiring should see this post.  It would be very useful information for both potential employers and for law enforcement if this person ever decides to try to inflict their views on someone else.	And as I said, his profile is completely public.  When/if he seeks employment, this will be very quick to pop up, and he'll have a lot of doors slammed in his face.  But in no way will I seek to actively slam those doors, because I have no right to interfere in his life when I know none of the circumstances. newlinechar  newlinechar You know, you do realize what you're doing, right?  You're advocating the very thing that will happen if the NSA gets a bug up its ass--using the fact that a majority of the populace is ignorant about how the internet works to obtain information that can easily be used to shame or subjugate them.  **It is immoral to do this, and I will have no part in it.**

Yes I have my own insecurities we all certainly do.  I speak out against strong opinions and judgments because they can often be wrong.  People we think we can trust turn out to be the wrong person to trust.  Sometimes you write off somebody because they seem a certain way.  Or because of completely unrelated preconceived conclusions.  I am talking about finding a balance and keeping everything in perspective.  I have personally made the mistakes of judging people incorrectly and it quite frankly hurt. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Every new action I learn about from that person will sway my opinion again to get closer to the multidimensional complete picture that I build of them. newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't that the same as judging somebody based on the body of their actions just worded a lot better. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And fwiw, I consider people posting nudes on gonewild to be exhibitionist, insecure and in need of reassurance. newlinechar  newlinechar I would say most of the post on GW suggest that.  But just not all of them necessarily.  You can be an exhibitionist and not insecure.  Some people wanna show off how great they think they are.  But those post that have titles like  'Does Reddit like big boobs I think my big boobs are ugly' or 'My boyfriend broke up with me please tell me that I am pretty' certainly suggest that they are insecure and need reassurance.  Just like every other human being on the planet.  Although I personally would not seek it in that way.	I guess we agree. newlinechar  newlinechar I just didn't like the way you seemed to discourage judgements based on single actions so I felt the need to reply. newlinechar  newlinechar Have a nice day.

And that was a couple years ago. newlinechar  newlinechar The thing with a pc is that you can reuse parts, you can reuse your software like windows or whatever. You can play all your old games. Hell you can play old console games. You can build it slowly and distribute the cost of components. Then in the end there is so much free content that the TCO ends up getting you far ahead of the game compared to consoles and you aren't locked down to one ecosystem. You miss out on a couple exclusives, but you get far more exclusives than console and you can carry them with you from machine to machine. Some of the titles I've purchased even extend their licenses to my android device (love me some humble bundle)... so the software side of things is way more enticing.	Don't get me wrong. I agree with..Well, most of that..It's all up for personal opinion. and if I had the money I'd every console and a gaming rig - I still prefer playstation, though. newlinechar  newlinechar All I'm saying is, a lot of 'pc gamers', are full of shit and tend to vastly over-blow how much a difference there actually is. and you can't claim 'master race' on something that's a matter of opinion. Some people don't care about graphics, some people hate keyboard/mouse controls, and a million other things.

This world needs a Super hero to deliver *petty Justice!*	It gets worse. I got three extra 3 hour detentions because some asswipe with the same name as me pulled a fire alarm in another school.

And my dad beat the shit out of me because he's some hypocritical ass who tells others to respect women, yet he never has. And he did again when I was blamed for the fire alarm.  
The Note 2 not being covered under insurance is what I was afraid of. But getting it for $250 being a fresh refurb is too good to pass up. I'm gonna try it out for a few weeks and see if I like it better than my S4. I only want to keep one.	Like I said I could be wrong. They may still honor it. Either way that's a great deal! I have the note 2 and it's by far the best phone I've ever owned. My only issue is I broke the screen within the first month of owning it so now I have an otterbox. But I'm also pretty hard on my phones.
Thanks for not answering my question. 	First part was the answer. Second part was commentary. Thanks for paying attention.

It's not attempting at all. I've started the bike with the kickstand down before. 	So the bike has no kickstand safety sensor? Then check the clutch safety. Wiggle the wire around and mess with the clutch while trying to start. I ended up unplugging the sensor totally. Look online how to remove the sensor on a KLR. It's not needed and will only leave you stranded if it doesn't click right.
but he's right. but if you like this boring ass shit deathball bio gameplay/meta then continue to love this dead game unconditionally.

The CBR should have been in 1st at that pedestrian speed, he wouldn't have needed to wait for anything then. Never ridden a CBR, but I imagine he bogged the poor motor pretty badly at that speed.

Nothing like getting after it on city streets and you feel like you're flying going through the gears when really you just hit 65 or so.

I don't want to spoil anyone's fun on any game. Good, bad, or overpriced. After all, it is my opinion based on the experience I had with it. If you were disappointed with Rise of the Triad, I advise you to be very careful with Shadow Warrior. Like you, I appreciate the older style of FPS games you mentioned, but you should not base your buying decision on one person's experience. Again, if you were disappointed by Rise of the Triad or Serious Sam 3 BFE, be careful. :) At least Rise of the Triad is priced accordingly.	The beta isn't the full game, the full game isn't out yet.

Just so you understand WHY this has gotten you so downvoted: Those rules exist for a reason.  newlinechar  newlinechar I get wanting to enjoy nature, which is why I take my dog to a dog park. I prefer to have her on a leash because I know she can be a grumpy ol' bitch sometimes around other dogs and that is ok so long as I can control it. What I was explaining above is that the situation becomes uncontrollable when other dogs are allowed off leash and can approach her without my (or her) consent.  newlinechar   newlinechar So yes, it does lead to myself and my dog being in harms way. Larger dogs roaming by themselves attempt to dominate her and when she reacts aggressively they sometimes respond in the same manner.  newlinechar  newlinechar She WILL snap/bite at other dogs when she gets scared, and that in turn makes them react the same way. Completely reasonable action/reaction but I'd rather her not be placed at risk for bodily harm or exposure to doggy illnesses from other people's pets. (EX I didn't realize it but for a month her rabies and other vaccines were expired. had another dog been a carrier and attacked her- and its possible for them to have been without their owner knowing if their owner was letting them off leash unsupervised often- I would just be a puddle of tears right now.)  newlinechar  newlinechar I hope that clarifies things for you. Unless you were trolling. But I'm gonna go ahead and post this just in case you're genuine. 	No I was not trolling.  I thought you were more concerned for the off leash dogs safety lest your dog get aggressive towards them.

Something along the lines of 'I feel like I could really develop some feelings for you because I find you (??? Interesting perhaps?) and if you feel the same way or would be willing to give this a chance, I'd really like to pursue it'? Cheesy, but honest and in case of realizing you don't like her you aren't even hypocritical. newlinechar  newlinechar Haha, I don't know. Just don't tell her you've been thinking of her so often, right away at least. That's something that should be saved until after you've been seeing each other for a couple months. But do mention things that you find compatible about you guys as a possible couple and what you find so alluring about her without being too descriptive. Accidentally commenting on things like eyes before meeting her in person might make it seem like you stalk her photos, even if you didn't and you just kind of glimpsed over it and it caught your eye. 	Would something along the lines of 'I'm really bummed that we never got to meet in person' be pushing it? Honestly, that is how I feel.

Yeah it pauses all the gameplay when you die. I was thinking that if I died, at least I could watch the flagship burn but no such luck!	Damn.

EMH has been shunned for years now. At least since 1990	That is my point- theoretical economics produces theories that aren't actually practically correct.

Why? It seems to make sense to me, you're claiming something that will cost you less and if you're lying that would cost the insurance company more. I think them having a right to prove it is fair.	I guess it's the whole fact that they have a legal reason to take your blood on a whim.  Seems like an invasion of privacy.  For example if you answered 'no' on a question of whether or not you smoke marijuana or do drugs, could they decide to give you monthly urine tests to ensure you are a profitable customer? newlinechar  newlinechar However if people read the fine print and they sign off on it, that seems more acceptable.

If the fights are beatable on the first try then it probably won't be a game for a lot of top end raiders. 	If a fight is unbeatable on first attempt, it has artificial difficulty.  The fight no longer becomes about your skill, but when and if you hit the pitfalls that kill your entire raid and there is nothing you can do about it but rez up and try again.  If this is the case, then the only difference between a top end raider and a high skilled player is that a top end raider is willing to burn a bunch of time the second a patch hits falling into pitfalls.  Personally, burning a bunch of time because the game said I don't deserve to kill a boss until it kills me once is absolutely unappealing. newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine a raid boss like a level in a hard platformer like Super Meat Boy or something.  Sure if you take your time and are cautious you can probably beat every level on your first try, but the execution required alone probably means you are going to make a mistake and have to do it over again.  Death is punishment for making mistakes in your judgement or lack of reflexes, not because you don't know the fight.  Wiping and repeating the fight can make up for poor judgement and lack of reflexes because you will have experience under your belt. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, what you are saying top end raiders want is trial-and-error gameplay, which is generally reviled by designers and players.  It is good for neither unskilled players nor skilled players, because it emphasizes time invested rather than personal and team capability.  Properly designed challenge allows for underskilled players to use trial-and-error to learn from their mistakes and use experience to make up for their skill, while skilled players can continue progressing or focus on optimizing their strategies. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar   
Well, if it was 1997 it would probably be Couture who lost a chunk of ear instead of Holyfield. The difference is cauliflower-ear ripping open would be a lot more graphic than what happened to Evander. 	Does a ruptured cauliflower-ear explode or what? I'm imagining they explode.
Well any thing *could* kill me. But that is besides the point. There has been a lot of research done on these creatures even though they are extinct. I will even except wikipedia, really anything that is more than what may just be your guesstimation. And if they are basically turkeys than the marines will stomp. **I** could kill 60 turkeys. I also again remind you of rule number 1 on the sidebar. 'Downvoting is for namby-pamby little wieners who can't argue their own position.'	They're not just turkeys.  You're assuming that since the comparison to being the size of a Turkey that they are Turkey like, which is patently false.  They're small carnivorous, warm-blooded hunters that could move up to speeds of 40mph in short bursts that killed their prey by leaping onto their backs and eviscerating them with their claws.  Now I don't know if that's how the turkeys in your area are, but if they are, then damn, I'd say you're a badass.

How does a lobster tank stop working?  Like the pump stop oxygenating the water, are they heated or cooled, or is there other magical stuff in a lobster tank that keeps them alive that I don't know about?

The chance of complication is far lower then that of being beaten with a baton.  Even the most ardent anti-taser activist would have to admit that.	The chance of getting killed by a taser is indeed far lower than the chance of getting a bone broken. newlinechar  newlinechar But being dead is far worse, (and less repairable), than having a broken bone. newlinechar  newlinechar Just as important is the fact that how likely it is that a tasering will be fatal is not something an officer can reasonably be expected to predict.  Nor can a suspect reduce that risk after he has been tasered by complying with officers. newlinechar  newlinechar By contrast, it's much easier to judge how likely it is that a suspect will be badly injured because it generally increases with the length and severity of the beating.  And of course a suspect can always become compliant and end all risk of further injury. newlinechar  newlinechar ************************** newlinechar The point is simply that dismissing a tasering as a 'short term event' is to be willfully blind to the dangers posed by tasers.  newlinechar  newlinechar And that's not even getting into the possibility that tasers will be used more often than truncheons would be because they're simply easier.  There's a distinct possibility that the taser option makes a talk-down less likely.
I think you are correct, newlinechar  newlinechar History can only be re written so far though and we have a lot of data to work with. newlinechar  newlinechar Never really understood all the hate towards the greens, I have never been a greens voter but I don't see what is so wrong with them.	The press unfortunately holds a lot of power though, as they've displayed by touting Abbott despite the many and varied flaws in his policies.

Sorry but I don't think that his entire post is invalid and worthless because in his opinion something was done badly. newlinechar  newlinechar He can frame his argument however he wants, and his opinions are obviously different from yours, but you don't have to throw the baby out with the bathwater. newlinechar  newlinechar It's subjective. Rather than try to tear this to shreds why not contribute something constructive by posting your own article on depth of field so we can have more diversity of opinion.	I never said that his post was invalid. I said that he made a terrible argument. Those are two different things.  newlinechar  newlinechar I ascertained that he framed his argument poorly by looking through his comments. It wasn't that he was wrong, it's that his initial argument didn't appear to accurately convey his point of view. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: As to your other point, I wouldn't make a post like this because I think that this point is pointless.

Oh hell no. When I was younger, my mum would tell me that he really doesn't mean what he says, and that he does love us under all of that anger. I realized that if he truly did love us or about the wellbeing of the family, he would take measures to control his outbursts. I've recognized now that my mother is fine with him treating her like this, whether it's due to codependency, cultural reasons, or something else. I really don't tolerate any sort of injustice like that, which is why I always intervened when I thought he was being wrong and harsh towards her. I've seen that he has no intentions to change, nor does he care for how me or my mother are affected from his outbursts (he knows I became really depressed and started having suicidal thoughts, but his general attitude has been to tell me to stop being so sensitive). I don't want to rekindle any relationship with him once I move. Once I am financially independent and have a stable income, I want to pay back all the money he's ever spent on me and never look back. 	I wouldn't even bother paying him back. Fuck all that. newlinechar  newlinechar You've done your time. Now it's time to leave and forget he existed.
Don't you remember two years ago, as well? Georgia lost to Boise State, then to Carolina in a shoot-out. The Gamecocks have beaten angry Georgia teams in recent memory, on the road no less.

We could maybe do it but we're playing at their home stadium and I'd like for them to be floating high on a Clemson win when we venture into Athens. I do know our streak against UGA and I want the best circumstances possible to beat them.

You mean like this? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Blue is the colour of the clear sky and the deep sea.[2] On the optical spectrum, blue is located between violet and green.[3] newlinechar Surveys in the U.S. and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, and confidence.

Why do you think they didn't film? Was is because they wanted people to witness the live shows themselves rather than watch them on a screen?  Led Zeppelin had a similar approach with their touring as well. It's unfortunate because I would love to see concert footage of them during 1974 when they played Shine On, Raving and Drooling, You've Got to Be Crazy, and all of Dark Side.	Man, I feel you on that one. I honestly have no clue. I hope that maybe Gilmour or Waters just have crystal clear quality films of their performances hidden away, but who knows. What I do know, is that Waters does have professionally shot footage of one of their shows at Earl's Court during The Wall tour. I hope he does release that, it would be amazing.

As amazing as it is, it kinda makes you wonder how we would manage fully evacuating a big city like NY in the event of a major catastrophe in even a remotely timely manner.

I'm the same way.   I'm about 20 lbs underweight and people talk about it all the time.   I know they don't mean anything by it, but it gets old explaining that you do eat and aren't smoking crack a half dozen or more times a day! 	Yeah the funny thing as somebody that's always been underweight myself, just like fat people way underestimate their caloric intake, underweight people way overestimate the amount of calories they get per day (but just can't seem to gain weight). It's hard but if you want to gain weight, you have to actually force feed yourself and eventually it will get easier. I did it, and the bodyweight is much easier to maintain than to gain. Also pick things up and put them down. 
And you thought German was a stern-sounding language already...	It's not just the language.

&gt; across Christianity, those are the ones losing members, whereas the Pentecostals and Catholics are the ones gaining. newlinechar  newlinechar That's the bottom line, isn't it? I would add one more group that is gaining - non-denominational 'Bible Church' type congregations.	Unfortunately, finding membership/attendance data for non-denoms is hard since there is no central agency to provide statistics for their congregation(s).. So the closest ones you can probably use are Nazarines, Assemblies of God, and Church of God - and they're all growing really, really fast.

I wasn't trying to insult you, I was just trying to say in a more subtle and funny way that it's easier for people like me to enjoy things, without being annoyed by small details.  newlinechar I did find what you said rather interesting, so there's that.  newlinechar I'm probably just a little tired by all the people on TWcenter or whatever who jump on every single inaccuracy Rome II has, such as having gladiators in it, forgetting that Rome II is a game, not a history textbook.  newlinechar I wonder if that has anything to do with the shortage of history inspired films such as Gladiator or Braveheart or Kingdom of Heaven.	Well....trying to compare Gladiator or Braveheart to Rome is just insulting to Rome. Seriously, Rome has minor things to nitpick - the most major would probably be them saying that Caesar was a consul at the same time as Pompey. Gladiator and Braveheart are just...wrong. In SO many ways. As I tell people, they're great films, just don't expect to learn any history whatsoever from them. Hence the reason why I consider Rome to be infinitely better than either of them :P Hell, Kingdom of Heaven wasn't half bad either, if you watch the director's cut. But Gladiator/Braveheart/The Patriot....*shudder* newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest issue is that, despite the fact that these films use Hollywood license VERY liberally, they still claim to have 'historian consultants.' That leads to people taking them seriously. People taking them seriously leads to misconceptions all OVER the place, which leads to people thinking they know more about history than historians, which causes bad education to happen. You wouldn't imagine how many times I've had people tell me *in person*, completely believing what they were saying, that 300 was pretty accurate, sans the monsters.  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I can't wait for Rome II to come out - as you said, it's a game and I'm not pushing perfect accuracy on that ;) It's the misconceptions that SPAWN from that that I try to fix as much as I can :) Does that make more sense? (We actually had a question over at /r/askhistorians yesterday about whether or not gladiators were used in battle that I never got the chance to answer. Hmm....) 
I don't have a problem with it. E-Cigarettes are undoubtedly better for you than analog. They can also be used as a method of quitting nicotine use all together. But that doesn't mean that they have no health impact. And we're still in early days of both understanding and regulation of them. I think it is fair for e-cigarettes to be considered at least the same as other forms of nicotine use at least until we can get some peer reviewed, conclusive studies.	Oh sure, like patches and gum, which are conspicuously nowhere to be found in that list...
Wow. That's weird. I feel like I've seen it before though. It is creepy as fuck though. 	Me too! I remember that I saw it like many years ago with another name. In the comments they say something bout a possesed dog and I remember something bout a dog though.
I guess its personal judgment, but I think of 'cat butt' as happening after a blowout, a traumatic event or rushed stretching.

Still downsizing due to paranoia but I guess it's better to be safe than sorry.
So listen, if one was to go to there local shop and buy up every copy of the paper, it would only cost ~$40, the shop owner would be happy because he's making his share, but the viewership would be zero. If lots of people went to their local shop and bought up all the papers then the paper would be fucked. Who would advertise with a paper with zero readership? It would take 3 days before everyone pulled out. 	What? But you bought all the papers? They got their money and now the newsagent is going to order more the next day because he sold out. How is that a win for anyone?

It's a unique situation, for sure. Generally, though, the best thing you can do is be a model tenant. You've been given keys and have a record of cheques (which I assume your landlady has been depositing). If this ever gets escalated, you have pretty hard evidence that a verbal agreement has been reached. Keep pressuring for the paperwork, but I'd keep paying, too. Tenants that withhold rent as leverage open themselves up to he-said-she-said situations with the RÃ©gie. 	I'm not *trying* to withhold payment. I should have worded things differently in the original post - I am a bit stressed and may sound more resentful/uncooperative than I am. I have emailed her telling her I have not yet paid because I do not know how she wants me to go about it. I told her I want to pay my rent and clear things up but I cannot pay her if she doesn't even tell me where to go or how to pay. She has my deposit for July and I told her I have money ready to be given to her for August and September the moment she tells me what I need to do to pay her.

this isn't agricultural per se, but in the UK the dairy industry receives huge government subsidies because Tesco, Co-op ect all pay farmers less per gallon than it cost's to produce, I'm not sure how it got that way but it seems like insanity and i myself don't understand how/why that works but it is the situation here anyway. I will try and remember the documentary i learned that in.	'The row centres on the 'farm gate' price paid to Britain's 14,500 dairy farmers, most of whom will, from 1 August, receive just 25p a litre for the milk they produce compared with around 30p before.

I'm afraid I don't get what the angst is about.  Why should you not still be best friends?  Is it better to have sex with someone you're not friends with?  If you don't find each other attractive and don't want to date, just forget about it and agree not to mention it ever again.  If you do find each other attractive and feelings you have for each other but were denying have surfaced, be happy.	I'm afraid it isn't that simple. What if we decide to go for a relationship and things don't work out? I most likely would lose his friendship. Like I said, we both have mutual feelings about all that's happened and we've already agreed to just keep things where they are

Celestiasbeard got all the recent events. Some minor details: Lord English isn't as concerned with sessions as he is with universes.

'2 gender'? Gay parents do just fine, it's the influence of having a missing parent that's the problem.	2 parent is definitely part of the issue and same sex couples do better than single parents, however, I believe (my own feels) that a child needs deep exposure to both genders as they grow up, same sex parents have to reach out to third parties to provide that exposure, and often do.   newlinechar  newlinechar Women can not replace men and men can not replace women in the development of children and you'll never, ever get me to believe otherwise.

Well it's a strange fight scene, because yes, it's funny as all hell, but feels really legit too. The fight doesn't feel choreographed at all, well for the most part anyway. Like when he accidentally smashes Keith David's car window, then laughs about it. Really felt like an accident. newlinechar  newlinechar There's nothing flashy at all in it, intricate martial arts or whatever, its all brute force. It's a fight between two guys where neither really seem to know much about fighting beyond putting your fist into the other guys face. Its lasts like seven minutes but stays consistently interesting the entire time.  newlinechar  newlinechar The injuries accrue through the fight semi naturally, like Keith David having that skin scraped off the back of his head. It feels like the two get winded and lose endurance naturally through the course of both exerting themselves and getting punched multiple times. newlinechar  newlinechar Things like that I think make it a really memorable fight. Sure it's not the most realistic fight, few in cinema are. But it feels incredibly honest, like I could step out of a bar and see this fight going on. So yeah, it rocks.	So the short answer to my half-question was: Both. newlinechar  newlinechar Really, that's the same feeling I get from the fight. No goofy camera tricks, no professionally choreography. Obvious pulled punches here and there, but clearly landed ones as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for the answer.

But generally speaking, politics stuff isn't nearly as highly moderated.	We both know it's a safe space, a panic room in the mansion that is reddit like most of the subreddits that you mod.

&gt; Making an airtight and easy case is the job of court personnel. newlinechar  newlinechar Yah but patrol and detective type LEO's do collect the evidence those courts use.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Court costs come out of a different department/budget newlinechar  newlinechar I own a house, and I pay property tax to the county. Every tax measure we vote in, authorizes the county to collect that tax on behalf of the city.  This is vastly different from sales tax, which the county/state expects each city to collect on its own.	I'm with you that it all comes out of our tax dollars. newlinechar  newlinechar The police dept and DA's office get different budgets for staff, salary, and how they spend their time.  They also report to different bureaucracies, so the DA gives no fucks how many hours/days/weeks the detective spent on the case, and likewise, the cops give no fucks how much time is wasted by the DA. newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, I agree that it is net more expensive to the taxpayer to keep the status quo than it would be to purchase and equip all SJPD officers with lapel cameras that were recording for each and every interaction with the public.  The fear of officers being held accountable, combined with the realization by some asshat lawbreakers that they are on obvious camera would help to tone down the hostility and showboating that happens on both sides of law enforcement encounters, resulting in fewer instances of uses of force, complaints against officers, and subsequent legal settlements when the cops are proved to be acting out of line.

Hahaha, that sounds great, could you tell me more about it? (title or link would be great but I'd take anything...)	It's in Xenophon's *Memorabilia*, book 3, chapter 11. The prostitute's name is Theodote. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Then Socrates, joking upon her easy life, said, âBut, Theodota, it is not easy for me to find leisure; for my own numerous occupations, private and public, allow me no rest; and I have female friends also, who will not suffer me to leave them day or night, learning from me love-charms and incantations.â 17. âDo you then know such arts, too, Socrates?â said Theodota. âThrough what other influence do you suppose that Apollodorus here, and Antisthenes, never leave me? and through what other influence do you suppose that Cebes and Simmias come to me from Thebes? Be assured, that such effects were not produced without many love-charms, incantations, and magic wheels.â newlinechar  newlinechar It's online [here](http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Memorabilia2.html). It seems to be a satirical recognition that Socrates is basically an intelligence-prostitute who leeches of folks who want him to be smart in their presence.

I'm not sure I follow. 	As Wiktionary defines it: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;A literary device of writing or art which principally ridicules its subject often as an intended means of provoking or preventing change. Humour is often used to aid this. newlinechar  newlinechar So an image of a fat, ridiculous looking, and decidedly un-fabulous person on a computer being described as 'in xir's natural habitat' is indeed satire. It's certainly not intended as a compliment! newlinechar  newlinechar (Am I the only one that feels there's something off at the 'provoking or preventing change' part? I never thought of satire that way.)
Just to add this side of things, I've been told that I have gay inflections even when I'm speaking a different language (French is my second language)... even when I wasn't out as bi.	Wow, that's interesting to me.

I'm guess they lost your trust because of the ME3 ending and DA2? Or was there more than just that.

it depends on the size of the battery. ideally you charge things until they're full, and then unplug them. things like smartphones and tablets are designed with being charged overnight in mind. the main thing people do they shouldnt, is leave their laptop on charge 24/7. that very quickly renders the battery useless.

Back then, metal was very expensive and only rich people could afford clocks with metal gears. Wood was significantly cheaper and allowed common people to have clocks. Metal was used only for highly wearing parts in those clocks, like the one in the center. A couple decades later, making brass became easier and cheaper and replaced wood.	Hmmm... I'm not sure that I agree. We have several antique clocks - not very expensive ones, and they all have metal gears. As I said, these were not really clocks for the rich - these are low to middle end clocks - two of them were sold in the Sears catalog. One is from 1893.

Perhaps the global economy needs to learn how to not waste so much energy? 	'Waste' is a byproduct of complexity. Complex systems become increasingly inefficient. This goes for ideological systems too, like governments. When a system becomes so complex [inefficient] that it begins to take more energy to simply maintain than it produces, it fails. This is why nearly all civilizations and empires have failed. And this, too, is why our current economic paradigm will fail. And many would argue it is already failing.

There was never any evidence he committed the crime though, not a single piece of evidence except he was in the general vicinity of where the other soldiers think the grenade came from, which was also occupied by an older man who had grenades and guns on him, but the older man was killed upon entering that area.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only soldier to go into that area, who is the one that killed the older man, reported that Khadr was unarmed, until a few weeks later when he changed his report stating that Khadr had a weapon with him, but the soldier isn't sure what it was. newlinechar  newlinechar So Khadr was held in prison for at minimum 4 years until while in Gitmo where he plead guilty and confessed because they told him he could go back to Canada if he did. He has since recanted that confession. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, he didn't just go there, he was taken to Afghanistan when he was 2 years old by his parents. newlinechar  newlinechar You really have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to Omar Khadr. I'm not an expert, but you should at least learn the basics before trying to argue a point on this topic.	Bluntly, none of that means squat.  His recanting means nothing. His confession means nothing.  And quite frankly, I think the evidence means nothing.  Seriously, it was a war zone, how much evidence of who threw what grenade does anyone think there was lying around to be collected? newlinechar  newlinechar And really, is there a single person who thinks that if he threw the grenade then he should rot in prison, but if not he should never have been in jail at all? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

It's in Xenophon's *Memorabilia*, book 3, chapter 11. The prostitute's name is Theodote. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Then Socrates, joking upon her easy life, said, âBut, Theodota, it is not easy for me to find leisure; for my own numerous occupations, private and public, allow me no rest; and I have female friends also, who will not suffer me to leave them day or night, learning from me love-charms and incantations.â 17. âDo you then know such arts, too, Socrates?â said Theodota. âThrough what other influence do you suppose that Apollodorus here, and Antisthenes, never leave me? and through what other influence do you suppose that Cebes and Simmias come to me from Thebes? Be assured, that such effects were not produced without many love-charms, incantations, and magic wheels.â newlinechar  newlinechar It's online [here](http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Memorabilia2.html). It seems to be a satirical recognition that Socrates is basically an intelligence-prostitute who leeches of folks who want him to be smart in their presence.	Awesome; thanks! newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Out of context bit from an earlier part I find strangely relevant: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; âNor was it, surely, for the sake of being noticed, for even madmen are noticed by everybody.â

Congratulations vSim, how long did it take you to learn the timing and master it for this mission? newlinechar True stealth speed mastery.	Lots, and lots of experimentation on timing and routes. Most of the experimentation was what gadgets to use (and when to use them), and how to avoid panther points by using them.  newlinechar  newlinechar Once I had a solid idea of what to do, took maybe 2.5 hours of restarting and frustration to string together everything.  newlinechar  newlinechar Doing Private Estate right now, and I pretty sure that I have a route down, just getting a lot of panther evasion points because of the dogs.

I remember watching a documentary about Transnistria, is it a recognised country yet?	Not by the majority of the international community, but a few of the countries around it (Moldova, Ukraine, Russia) accept its attempts at independence and talks are still ongoing. I think Moldova wants to assert the rights over it while still giving it a degree of autonomy, while Transnistria just wants full independence. It could take years to sort out, but the region is fairly stable these days. Or at least that's what reports say.
Nah, there's one guy that's kind of a dick.	The question is *why they keep asking him*
Oh for a job for you.  Well good luck.	Oh he's right though, if it's undisturbed, you're pretty much safe. All that needs to be done is to keep the walls, ceilings etc. in good condition. If you've got a leak, though,  that is an indication of poor condition. But asbestos-containing building materials are usually stronger than their modern counterparts. If any contractor comes to repair the roof, make sure (if they do any work in your place) that you get an actual report in your hands of the asbestos content of the affected materials.
That's true. I just gotta hope he can turn around. This is the time when I have to start pulling my own weight and make my own life. I don't want him in it. Hopefully he can make a good one for himself.	And with that, I wish you the best of luck.

There is no conspiracy and if you think Obama is being treated the same way Bush was I'd say you should see an analyst.	Who are you referring to when you say that, though?  'Pretty much everyone who ever had a negative thing to say about Bush' is a meaningless thing to say, because I would hope that encompasses 100% of the population... no president should go unscrutinized or uncriticized, and if you think the left in this country is mindlessly positive about everything Obama does you have things completely wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: I think the main problem I have is that it seems like you believe that Democrats just can't wait to go over and invade Syria.  This is really not the case.  If you have to make the claim that there are no anti-war protests, this isn't an accurate claim, because there are.  If you're claiming that they're irrelevant because they're not as big as the anti-Iraq War protests, then I'd say the main difference is that we haven't even figured out what the scale of our operation is going to be.

Not much to contribute, but thought I'd share that only having known them both as (among) the go-to institutions for post-grad professional qualifications, I saw this and had a quick look into BPP, and more surprising then the fact they offer basic LLBs they're also seemingly cheaper then the majority of popular universities offering a 'practice focused' study, which is a quality I feel general LLB courses in the UK are very much in need of. 	Hope you get some idea as to professional opinion on such schools, though I'm lead to believe that where you study draws lesser focus from employers as time goes on, to study at one of the few institutions offering LPC etc, study much more hands on and day to day then the academics of the average LLB would assumedly be quite attractive to employers...
Those that complain want their own personal music on it. newlinechar  newlinechar When its not about that, its about what fits the aesthetics and the game. newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, Heavy Metal. newlinechar  newlinechar Just doesn't suit this game.

When you buy a ticket you're not only buying a space for your body, but also all the extra equipment a passenger needs.

Yeah I know, it's a difficult system full of huge holes. Basically, any injuries caused by every day day to day kind of stuff, or excersize, would be covered, but only the things that everyone KNOWS is bad for you, such as smoking, drunk driving, drugs, obesity, would be on you. It's not a practical system, I agree, but would be perfect if someone could make it work.	It would be very hard to implement when mental illnesses are taken into consideration, too. Take the case of a failed suicide. Should that person have to pay their hospital bills in full for the treatment that kept them alive against their will? What about alcoholics who are self-medicating bipolar disorder with alcohol (have one of those in my family, btw)? I honestly think medical treatment and coverage of it shouldn't be based on a system that pays or doesn't pay out based on culpability criteria. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I DO think that incentivizing healthier lifestyles and behaviors IS a good system, though. As in --- offer discounts to the people who exercise at least 30 min a day 5x per week, to bipolars who take their mood stabilizers, the alchoholics who are actively in treatment, the obese who are trying to lose weight or who are improving their diets, etc.
And I'm cool with that, I think that players should be rewarded for their time, whether or not they screw up, and _especially_ whether or not all those _other_ players screw up. I totally agree with those who argued that the mechanics of the original Teq and Shat fights were overly simplistic, and applaud the addition of new mechanics, I just don't like the timer, and think that the build they showed seemed to take way too long to wear down his health. The mechanics look fun, but the amount of time you have to put up with them made them seem boring. 	&gt;I think that players should be rewarded for their time, whether or not they screw up, and especially whether or not all those other players screw up. newlinechar  newlinechar If you go into a fight knowing for certain that the reward is locked behind teamwork, you should be rewarded and punished for succeeding or failing at teamwork.  That goes for parties of 5 or 50. newlinechar  newlinechar And I don't think players are entitled to loot just for showing up.  Especially when most of PvE is completely faceroll already and it's not like Tequatl will give vital loot - the ascendeds will undoubtedly be too rare to rely on.
If he's 100%, that goes out. I think it's obvious that his shoulder still isn't 100% and his lack of power is showing that. He's had so many fly balls to the warning track this year.

That's pretty dissapointing. One of the greatest things would be being able to farm, explore, craft, do whatever you like and then just enter the dungeon and be back immediately afterwards. newlinechar  newlinechar Even RIFT had this years ago, are they unable, unwilling or inept?	It's a design decision. They don't want people just silently matching up with others and teleporting to dungeons as it's done in WoW, for example. You still have to talk and socialise with your group and get your character to dungeons, which to be fair requires very minimal effort considering how well connected the dungeons are with waypoints.

Yep, I noticed that (feels all guilty for not trying to submit something).  I figure that if we can get it out to other relevant subs and the Paizo/WOTC forums and not just make it exclusive to this sub, then maybe something will materialize.  I know for me that the idea of making maps is stressful, but putting together a text encounter is less so.  The terrain and mapping part is always what takes the most planning for me. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe this will work, maybe it won't.	I totally understand that about putting together a map.  In the very beginning a few people (including myself) had even mentioned just putting pencil to graph paper for a quick easy map.  I'm getting better with pyromancers.com and I think my last map of the goblin treetop village only took me about 30 minutes or so. newlinechar  newlinechar Haha and I like this sub ...

but for those of us who have little choice but to drink diet/sugar free beverages due to conditions such as Type 1 Diabetes, you really appreciate the flavor of Zero over Diet, especially since seemingly nowhere sells Pepsi max which IMO is arguably the best sugar free Cola available. newlinechar  newlinechar So next time you think someone is obnoxious for asking for zero, consider that they might have to drink diet and perhaps, just perhaps they choose zero because it tastes better. newlinechar  newlinechar tl;dr diet coke is nasty, zero is ok and nowhere sells Pepsi max so stop  being so judgmental because they might have to drink diet.	You've made me change my ways. Thank you so much for enlightening me.
&gt; No, he's racist because he points out 'haha look, we're working with racist tropes!' and then does nothing to parody it. Just making something self-aware that it's racist doesn't make it subversive, it just makes it unabashedly racist. newlinechar  newlinechar That is exactly what happened to *Family Guy* over time. It went from 'lol, look how racist and misogynist this silly white New Englander is' to 'lol women and minorities, amirite?'	I've discussed this exactly. Seth McFarlane's defenders used 'satire' as an excuse when he did the 'I saw your boobs' song too, and if it is satire, okay, fine, but the majority of his audience isn't in on the joke, and he is certainly still cashing their checks.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think this sort of laziness just happens in TV after awhile. Same thing with the Simpsons. It went from being satirical pop culture stuff, to just topical. More observational humor than societal satire. It's a shame.

Do it! I have actually kept every single letter of encouragement or thanks that I have received since starting college. I keep them in their own box and when I'm having a meh day I open the box, read a few, and it reminds me that I am playing a significant part in the grand scheme of things.	That's a really great idea. I'm a big fan of saving things for sentimental value and taking them out when you're having a bad day is just the perfect thing sometimes. I'm gonna find a box to use. :)
Again sorry its taking so long D: hope it meets your expectations 	Don't even worry about that! And I am so sure it'll be amazing just because you did it :)
Really? I agree that the outcry of 'moral collapse' comes a little too often and a little too free, but being an Atheist doesn't mean that you dispose entirely of any notion of morality. In fact that is one of the biggest christian myths about atheists  that 'if you don't believe in god,  you should be raping stealing and murdering.'  Women, especially young women, are definitely overly sexualized by our media, it doesn't matter if you're a humanist or a calvinist, there are serious negative consequences to the exploitation of one entire half of our species. If we treated them like equals, and not like fuck toys, maybe our society would run smoother from a pragmatic point of view. Atheism is not hedonism, try to be good without god.	Everyone should be treated equally; as fuck toys.
Beat is perhaps not the best word here. Ladies, think of your labias...do not do anything to a man's ballsack you would not want done to one of those.  newlinechar  newlinechar (In general, anyways.

Again we are in agreement that mining is indeed the ideal form of distribution. With that said we have a particular application here that is built on the existing Bitcoin blockchain and not an alternative blockchain, thus mining is not an option open to us.  newlinechar  newlinechar Therefore the question becomes what is the best non-mining option? There are plenty of potential answers (some better than others), random distribution, give aways, distribution for tech development or business development. I think J.R. sincerely believes that this mixed approach of offering them Kickstarter style to those that support the features + a small pool for tech dev and bus dev purposes is a logical solution. And I agree with that conclusion.  newlinechar  newlinechar As to the scam issue again I'd say that someone has to benefit from a scam for it to make sense. Well here is a guy (J.R.) that put up a $100K plus of his own BTC because he believes in this effort. As has been pointed out below he isn't going to get back those dollars back as a salary, but instead those BTC will go to developers and so I'm not sure how he is benefiting unless he sincerely believes the project will have utility.  newlinechar  newlinechar And your point is well taken. If the market decides there isn't utility in the project than the funds put to this purpose will not generate a great outcome.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'll be sure and work to see these funds are spent transparently and cash efficiently, because yes you can count me among the people who supports this effort.  newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks again for all your input.	He put 100k+ of his money into a Bitcoin account that he has the private keys to. That's not any kind of an investment on his part, it's shuffling money from one pocket into the other. When this 'mastercoin' isn't worth shit a few months from now he'll still have all of his Bitcoins (and everyone else's).

It would be very hard to implement when mental illnesses are taken into consideration, too. Take the case of a failed suicide. Should that person have to pay their hospital bills in full for the treatment that kept them alive against their will? What about alcoholics who are self-medicating bipolar disorder with alcohol (have one of those in my family, btw)? I honestly think medical treatment and coverage of it shouldn't be based on a system that pays or doesn't pay out based on culpability criteria. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I DO think that incentivizing healthier lifestyles and behaviors IS a good system, though. As in --- offer discounts to the people who exercise at least 30 min a day 5x per week, to bipolars who take their mood stabilizers, the alchoholics who are actively in treatment, the obese who are trying to lose weight or who are improving their diets, etc.	I know, its in no way practical. I don't plan on trying to take over HealthCare and imlpement this. I just think, if someone managed to develop omnipotent superpowers, and could be 100% unbiased, then it would be the perfect system. That's not likely to happen though...

Or use an oxygen controller to fill the inside with oxygen, and have it realistically blast out of open doors. Ships with multiple rooms would have to have air ducts. Therefore, new block: vent (solid block that air can flow through). I know it would take a lot of coding, but it would be awesome. 	I agree. Air must only be inside the sealed ship, with the oxygen supply. If the oxygen block is exposed to the outside through any hole, then the air in the ship drops to 0.

Thank you.  I think I'm actually getting somewhere now. newlinechar  newlinechar First, is this what I'm looking for, and is this a trustworthy source for downloading something I'm going to install and run? newlinechar  newlinechar https://www.downloadster.net/open-office-writer/ newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Things you might be confused by newlinechar  newlinechar Here's another.  Am I supposed to save what I write in some particular form?  If so, what?  Do I save it as an ebook or something? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Upload an image in jpg format, I prefer 1800px by 2700px. This will be the cover image that people see when they're looking at your book in the store page, and when they look at the cover on their Kindle device. newlinechar  newlinechar I assume I can make this in anything that makes images?  Does it have to be 'jpg format' or can it be something else?  And is the size you mentioned better for some reason than another size?  It seems pretty big to me. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Upload your book file. newlinechar  newlinechar See, to me this is like saying 'put the crate on the truck' and I'm just beginning to see what you're getting at.  My 'book file' is what, exactly?  What I saved in OpenOffice Writer?  I'm guessing that I tell KDP the name of it and it will find it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it'll take a few hours to upload newlinechar  newlinechar Hours?  I have to leave my computer sitting as I wait?  Or do you mean it won't show up somewhere for hours, not that the upload actually takes that long? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If you don't show nudity and your book doesn't involve incest, bestiality, or other illegal sex acts, you should be fine. newlinechar  newlinechar You mean they'll reject it if you WRITE about things that are illegal??  Or is it just sex things that are illegal that they censor?  That seems bizarre.  What jurisdictions are they talking about, in any case?  If it's just sex things you can't write about, that won't be a problem for me, that's not what I write, but it's still bizarre. newlinechar  newlinechar Final question, does this method publish the ebook everywhere, or is this just for Amazon?	I'm on my phone right now, so I can't check that download link. You can find safe links at openoffice.org though. newlinechar  newlinechar You want to save as .doc, which is Word 95-2003 if I recall correctly. newlinechar  newlinechar Jpg or tiff are the two acceptable formats. The size I suggested will allow you to use it for print at 6x9 if you decide to go that route. I prefer not to close doors for no reason. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as upload the book file, I mean the .doc file you saved, yes. newlinechar  newlinechar Once you submit your document, you do not need to leave you computer sitting. Think of it like dropping your roll of photos at the pharmacy. You don't need to sit there waiting. newlinechar  newlinechar It's just sex things, primarily in America. Only obvious things. Incest and bestiality are the big ones, outside of those you should be fine. newlinechar  newlinechar The good is done though so I have to go. I'll follow up when I get home.

Can't answer about the t4, but when you say 'juice leaking to the mouthpiece' when you refill, do you mean that when you turn it over, juice leaks out of the mouthpiece? If so, that's actually just condensed juice that builds up in the tube as you vape. Annoying, but it's not actually a leak. Just a reality of the design. :)

If a fight is unbeatable on first attempt, it has artificial difficulty.  The fight no longer becomes about your skill, but when and if you hit the pitfalls that kill your entire raid and there is nothing you can do about it but rez up and try again.  If this is the case, then the only difference between a top end raider and a high skilled player is that a top end raider is willing to burn a bunch of time the second a patch hits falling into pitfalls.  Personally, burning a bunch of time because the game said I don't deserve to kill a boss until it kills me once is absolutely unappealing. newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine a raid boss like a level in a hard platformer like Super Meat Boy or something.  Sure if you take your time and are cautious you can probably beat every level on your first try, but the execution required alone probably means you are going to make a mistake and have to do it over again.  Death is punishment for making mistakes in your judgement or lack of reflexes, not because you don't know the fight.  Wiping and repeating the fight can make up for poor judgement and lack of reflexes because you will have experience under your belt. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, what you are saying top end raiders want is trial-and-error gameplay, which is generally reviled by designers and players.  It is good for neither unskilled players nor skilled players, because it emphasizes time invested rather than personal and team capability.  Properly designed challenge allows for underskilled players to use trial-and-error to learn from their mistakes and use experience to make up for their skill, while skilled players can continue progressing or focus on optimizing their strategies. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar   	There have been very very few fights in WoW that in their fixed form could kill you without you having a chance no matter what. In that sense any WoW fight could be seen as beatable on the first try, which matches your definition. This is what I already thought, which simply leads to the question I'm asking; when compared to different WoW raid fights, where will the top end difficulty lie? In a spot that top 50 world guilds will blow through? Or fights that top 3000 world guilds will blow through?

GOMAD works well, but I'd only go all out with a gallon a day if you are seriously under weight.  Most of us only need an extra 200-500 calories extra a day, and should only gain .5-1 pound a week.

2 parent is definitely part of the issue and same sex couples do better than single parents, however, I believe (my own feels) that a child needs deep exposure to both genders as they grow up, same sex parents have to reach out to third parties to provide that exposure, and often do.   newlinechar  newlinechar Women can not replace men and men can not replace women in the development of children and you'll never, ever get me to believe otherwise.

No, I expect parents to try and not be disruptive. If you're going somewhere that is for your kid, you are buying something for your kid, it is a kid-friendly environment, etc, bring your kid. If your kid can be quiet and won't bother anyone, take your kid. But if your kid starts crying and annoying everyone, don't ignore the little noise machine and continue looking at cameras. Either get him to be quiet, take him out of the store until he calms down so he is not bothering anyone, or next time try and arrange for a way to leave him at home.

Its not fair to say that blacks were the only minority to face challenges though. Yes, its true they were forced to come here and that was fucking bullshit. But there is a long history of this country's mistreatment of asians like the yellow panic and the internment of japanese americans during WW2. Hell even other kinds of white people had it pretty rough like the irish during the early 1800s. There are advantages and disadvantages to being any race. Blacks and latinos  have the advantage of affirmative action, asians and indians have the advantage of a strong cultural importance placed on school and professional acheivement. Whites get to be white.  newlinechar  newlinechar So yes it is bullshit that blacks with no criminal records are prefered to whites with one. That is awful. But not much more awful that an asian or indian has to do better than a black or latino to get into the same school. There's unfairness everywhere and saying that the system is to blame for all of the bad things that have ever happened to any minority wont solve the problem.	They are not the only minority to face discrimination, in that you are correct. However, they are the only minority to face continual oppression organized by the government on multiple levels through the entire history of the country up to and including the present. Let alone the prevalence of individual racism in many parts of the country. newlinechar  newlinechar When you complain about affirmative action you fail to acknowledge the vastly superior advantages of access to economic opportunity that other groups enjoy. The list is long, [redlining and disinvestment](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=cplan_papers) have utterly destroyed the capacity of black communities to sustain themselves, stop and frisk policies disproportionately impact black (and latino, for that matter) communities *even though whites are [more likely](http://rt.com/usa/stop-frisk-whites-drugs-weapons-667/) to have drugs or weapons*. Let alone the impact of sentencing laws that made one type of cocaine result in much longer and harsher sentences than the type popular with white people. newlinechar  newlinechar Many of these things have continued into the present day and are vastly more harmful than the minor advantages of affirmative action (which itself is largely gone, it hasn't existed in California, for example since Proposition 209 was enacted in 1996).  newlinechar  newlinechar When you start to dig into the level of economic destruction that federal, state, and local *government* policies have wreaked on black communities (I'd recommend the book [The New Jim Crow](http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595586431/) by Michelle Alexander for a quick overview) it becomes impossible to compare the brief internment of Japanese Americans during WWII or the Irish even further back in our country's history to what the black community has faced for decade after decade.

It's overrated in the sense that people who would want to emulate the main character completely miss the moral of the movie's story. It's overrated in the sense that Tony Montana is not really a hero but a tragic character (duh). I love the hell out of this movie but I feel that many people who like it (hip-hop artists) simply stop watching the movie after the montage with the wedding and the tiger. Montana achieves everything he sets out to do to the very end of his dreams only to realize his dreams were empty and unsatisfactory. And it isn't even just a snap realization right before kicking the bucket. The movie spends a whole dinner scene rolling around in the utter disappointment Montana finds at the end of his criminal rainbow. It's only after he's fully taken it all in that he self-destructs and literally destroys the lives of everyone around him.  newlinechar  newlinechar This would be a memorable movie for how quotable it is or for the killer performance from Pacino, one of his last great ones.

I have come close, VERY close to spanking but I don't think that's something I want to do. I don't want to teach her that inflicting physical pain on someone is ok. newlinechar 	I understand. I have raised two kids, and a measured, controlled non-vindictive approach to spanking worked for me and my wife. We spanked our kids when they were too young to reason with--not when we were angry; not enough to really cause pain, just a couple reasonably light smacks on a clothed bottom worked wonders. I respect that other parents do not choose this as an option; I do. But when the child isn't old enough to comprehend reasoning and is oppositional, it is a perfectly workable option, because it's not the pain that convinces them to do what you want--it is the shock of, 'I just got hit!?!' That puts them off of whatever oppositional stance they had taken and they comply. BUT I never spanked with anything other then a hand, never on an unclothed bottom, and never never never out of anger. Some parents spank to relieve the anger they feel--that's not a good reason to spank a child. Just my two cents--I hope your situation improves, and the best of luck to you and your family.

Hey, this looks nice! My load order is too full and complicated to actually use, but the idea is a good one.

I also did add more legionaries to the fort. If you really want a good fort expansion I would get this one: [Fortification Hill Expansion](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43653//?). I actually didn't add to the fort because of one fact, and that is I didn't want to spend a lot of time on one location. This mod is more based on the spawns and camps I added around the southeast portion of the map, and not about one expansion. I may do that in a separate mod or in a future update though, so stay tuned. :)

Get a friend to piss in a condom for you and strap that shit to your leg (take a thumb-tack or something sharp to stab it with eventually; trust me). If it takes more then 10-15 to get to the test site; use one of those hand-warmers and put it on-top of the condom to keep the piss at the right temp or else you will fail the test.  newlinechar  newlinechar This works because I have seen at least 3 friends do it.

I honestly don't have an issue with the turn-based combat; I'm a huge JRPG fan so that style of combat comes with the territory. It's mostly the snowbally combat, your access to income, and the dungeon crawler-esque way the game handles it's dungeons IMO.  newlinechar  newlinechar One Mores give you incentive for manipulating an enemy's weakness, however there's no efficient way to maintain your MP throughout a dungeon once you're there. You can constantly hit enemy weaknesses, however you'll end up burning through your MP before you get to the end of the dungeon (or even halfway through it, tbh). This would not be an issue except for 2 reasons: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Things in this game cost way too much money. Everything that would give you longevity in a dungeon (equipment upgrades, recovery items, the Fox) cannot be effectively replenished inside said dungeon and/or they're freakishly expensive. You don't get much money or usable items from combat, so I found myself leaving constantly to heal and only using the Fox's horribly overpriced healing as a last resort (like 'if I leave this dungeon to heal, it's Game Over').  newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Auto-attacks are REALLY bad in this game. If you run out of MP, your efficiency in combat tanks. Hard. Even Strength heavy characters inflict marginally more damage with auto-attacks, and they're far less efficient because they can't consistently proc crits (meaning they can't effectively use One Mores). newlinechar  newlinechar Both of these factors create a situation where you have to keep starting and stopping a dungeon multiple times, and for people with an aversion to grinding, it's gets old fast. 	Basically, they don't want you going through the whole thing in one go, that's why you run out of MP and it's not easy to replenish. Their way to stop you in P3 was when your party got tired, but in P4 there's no such thing, so basically running out of MP is their way of saying that you've had enough.
It all depends on how I'm feeling in the moment. Usually I'll take a few chipotle peppers out with some sauce and save them for a future marinade or something. It makes me happy that you enjoyed it :)	Seriously loved it and my hubby really loved it. I think it's a regular in our house now!!

Your explanation of these beliefs is fascinating, so thank you. newlinechar  newlinechar However, I'd like to point out that your assumptions of atheists/agnostics are not very informed and I feel betray a certain amount of close-mindedness on your part.  newlinechar  newlinechar Let alone the assumption that atheism is a result of teenagers trying to rebel/establish their identities.

So what you said here: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;does this belief system you've explained reject archaeological and historical records? newlinechar  newlinechar Warrants a yes and no. The *traditional* belief system doesn't reject it, it just wasn't formulated when these discoveries were put to paper. I'd say that most modern, non-conservative, Hindus accept the archaeological and historical records as fact and consider the events of, say, the *Ramayana*: colossal demons meditating in the Himalayas for millenia, hunting humans in the forests, people being turned to ash and back, wandering story-tellers who neither eat nor sleep, etc. as nothing more than myth.

So, he just flew off the handle and fired you? You sound like an outstanding employee so I just have a hard time picturing this.  Did he mention and other reason as to why he did this? newlinechar 	I found out *later* what the problem was, but at the time I had no idea. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said in my post, he was extremely supportive of me going to school. I was taking two classes and left half an hour early four days a week to make it on time. I skipped my traditional 30 minute lunches on those days to account for it. In no way, shape, or form did it detract from my quality of work or timeliness. When he fired me, I had four classes left before I was done. Apparently, he couldn't afford to lose two more hours of my time that week. I shit you not, a confidant of his who still worked there, told me he said it. That employee and I had been friends, still talk to this day, and I used him to probe and keep his ear low to the ground for me to find out reasons. This was one of them. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, apparently, he thought my head was getting too big because my confidence had grown immensely due to my degree of success at work. He felt like I was trying to take his job. Sorry old hippie; I'm not looking to do this for the rest of my life. I hate signs, I just enjoy my job. newlinechar  newlinechar Most likely, the reason was because of my father's restaurant. He owns a large chain of restaurants as part of a franchise and our city's NBA team is partnered up with him for a lot of stuff. My dad was getting **massive** window stickers installed in his downtown restaurant (his first location) to advertise for the basketball team. DM and his wife were friends with my parents; their only daughter and my middle sister were and still are close friends. That's how all of this came about to begin with. Anyway, naturally my dad turned to DM and wanted his company to do the install. They did the first of what was going to be many installs a week before I was fired and fucked up royally. I was the one who answer my father's raging phone call when he tried reaching DM, who doesn't believe in having a PC or a cell phone. His employees do, but he doesn't. So I got to field the call. And do the field inspection. Because no one wanted near this. The restaurant chain is very well known, and it was no secret my dad's the dude who owns it. The kicker? The sign company refused to take responsibility for any of it. newlinechar  newlinechar Shortly after I was termed, DM refused to return to the site to fix the poorly done work. It turned into a problem that grew way out of hand because the sign company battled the terms of the contract. My father took him to court, won, got all his money plus some back, and had DM's sign company blacklisted not only by the main franchise headquarters, but by the main arena here in the city where our NBA team plays, X-Games comes, and major shows are played at. This forced a lot of existing projects with the sign company to get cancelled because the arena in town did previously have them as their preferred installer. DM's company lost both the restaurant's national and regional business (here in the state, my father just opened his 21st restaurant), but is blacklisted by our city's arena and smaller colosseum it oversees as well where smaller acts perform.  newlinechar  newlinechar The entire incident put a lot of stress on DM and I the week between the poor install and me being fired. I have a feeling this is the largest contributing factor to my termination. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Sorry, this wasn't very clear. My *father* isn't the one who got them blacklisted; the respective restaurant franchise board and NBA / entertainment partners backed out due to the experience my father had been through. Neither of them wanted to work with a company who put one of their partners through what the sign company did to my father. It just goes to show how far good customer service versus bad customer service can take you. newlinechar

Kendra was trained her whole life in preparation for the *possibility* of becoming the Slayer - that's how her people worked, they knew about the vampires and Slayers and believed it was a huge honour. Faith, I'm pretty sure, was a huge liar, trying to be macho. She *could* have had all those crazy experiences, but I doubt she had *all* of them. She always seemed a little batshit crazy and exaggerating stories of how badass she was seems right in character. Obviously the Kakistos story was legit because he killed her Watcher - could have been the first monster she ever faced and she just sucked. Oh, and you get a Watcher like straight away when you're 'called'. Buffy's first Watcher showed up immediately when the previous Slayer died and he also got killed before the summer was out.	I missed that part about Kendra's people being in on it. I guess Faith being full of shit makes enough sense. Alright then, carry on!
Lol you asshole	hey, I'm not the one sending you dick pics that you know of. 
Lions are older than your franchise son.	All the more sad we haven't sniffed a Super Bowl.
Thanks for the support! How do you go about looking for caves?	You can run around all over the over world and most of the time youll see them since they have pots and chests. If not, you can dig straight down and you'd have to be the unluckiest terrarian to not hit a cave.

[](/ajbook) Well, I am a doctor.	[](/cheeriwaitwhat) You serious? No. You can't be.
Thanks, I've been muffing that up for a solid month, then.	Yeah... I just haven't had the heart to tell you until now... :P It's alright, though! I'm really looking forward to him tonight. SKC is a team against which we will really need his creative ability.
You'll find I'm serious more often than I'd like to be.  This is, however, a serious moment, yes.	In that case, THANK YOU.
TSM already has Regi's other worldly Karthus, plus DYRUS' GODLIKE KARTHUS ? 	I think Dyrus' Karthus is even scarier - I think his fits better in the current meta.  Better to have regi on that ahri/zed type assassin and Dyrus on global artillery/teamfight zoning.
From what I've heard they have to let the pedo do all the initiating.

The joke is more aimed at nephrologists starting dialysis on someone who's already actively dying.  newlinechar  newlinechar And to say that a certain specialty should never have to talk about palliative care is kind of appalling. Treating patients ethically is everyone's responsibility.	It is everyone's responsibility, and it is surprisingly often that a nephrologist has to be the one to broach the subject of palliative care.  But it should be the job of primary or the person who specializes in the disease said person is actively dying from who has that kind of frank discussion.  It is sad when the nephrologist has to be the first one to tell someone that they are dying of cancer or COPD or CHF, etc.  
If I absolutely had to guess, I'd say that it was sugar falling out of suspension.  	Listen to this guy.
Ah, thanks! You're a life saver!	yeah, my way is way to complicated he's more right
&gt;what is a polarized filter? newlinechar  newlinechar [CPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizing_filter_%28photography%29) is a glass element that can be attached to the front of any given lens that will negate reflections that are at ~90degress to the incident light.  By rotating the filter you will see the sky darken with deep blues and unwanted reflections from water at 90degrees or glass and to some degree metal surfaces vanish (this cannot be done using PS).  CPL decrease light by 2 stops (theoretically, practically some more) so you will have to compensate with a slower shutter, wider aperture or higher ISO.  But mostly since it is used during bright light conditions it turns out to be OK compromise. newlinechar  newlinechar I would not fuss with the 'A) 0.45 wide angle lens B) 2X telephoto lens C) a three piece filter kit ( uv-cpl-fld)'.  Because all these attachments will degrade lens resolution (which is nice for this X20).  And do not go with filter kits, it will cost less but usually those are subpar glass.  trust B+W brand or Heliopan or Hoya.  You do not want the extra piece of glass to interfere, degrade or introduce artifacts to the fine lens the X20 sports.	You are the best, thank you newlinechar  I can hug you :)  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm saving this post for reference, I'll look into those brands and for a polarized filter.  newlinechar  newlinechar I appreciate your time :) 
I know someone who does that, it's so gross...	Oh my god why....

Its hard to hate someone you haven't heard about. 	Therefore, according to your logic, more than 6 billion people must share the award of the least hated person in the world, since every one can't 'know' more than, say, a few hundreds persons at most.
My boss had this happen to him last week. The exterminator asked him if theyâd gnawed through his walls yetâapparently a common occurrence. :\	If they were actually bees and not wasps he should have called the closest bee farm and had them take them.

As a straight man, I would act exactly the same. I'm in a happy relationship and I don't feel the need to flirt with every cute girl anymore.

haha. enjoy it while you can! Having kids certainly bumps up the price of food shopping :P Plus my parents live too far for me to steal food anymore =[ Other wise I'd be at my moms raiding her food right about now haha	Oh god I know. Kids are ridiculously expensive. My first nephew is due on the 30th, so I've been spending my make-up money on the most adorable little babygrows and stuff. It's worth it though. 
I thought Jones had a more spectacular performance. Flacco played well but he played to his level. Jones exceeded my, and I think many people's, expectations for him as a receiver.	He still was only responsible for 2 touchdowns to Flacco's 3.   A passer rating of 124 or whatever it was is crazy in a Super Bowl.    Plus Jacoby only had one catch.  I can see where you're coming from, I just think Flacco deserved it more.
Exercising and eating healthy wouldn't hurt though.	Exactly, but for some reason HAES followers tend to discredit many forms of exercise. HAES is 'health at every size' so yes, if you truly are 'healthy at every size' then you'll be able to run a few miles and walk up the stairs without breaking a sweat. newlinechar  newlinechar But no, running is bad for you tee^hee

how difficult is that game? a friend of mine described it with an example, one of the heroines, given a certain choice, [] (/s 'axes you to death, with insight of her father or something'). what it sounds like to me is that you play through it a bunch of times and eventually you sort of feel which answers you should give for the desired ending. is that right or does it help you out a little?  newlinechar  newlinechar i want to play it, but i dont like using guides, only peeking at them to see the general structure of the game (linear like steinsgate and g senjou or branching like little busters or katawa shoujo), recommended route order, and how the choices work. 	With 999 the different endings are reached based on the doors you choose. The puzzles are not *too* difficult, but they are challenging.
A lot of people dislike the Snooty personality, and I don't know why, I adore my Ankha. 	I have Ankha too!! Yes, I like that personality too. Sometimes they are nicer than peppy villagers!
Ok?  I was just expressing my opinion, like you just said yours.

Yeah, I know that road well. And I will be the last one to condemn it. You do what you have to do, absent a diagnosis and adequate treatment. People are quick to judge, but they don't have to live in your head.  newlinechar  newlinechar In my experience- and that's all it is- people who are drinking all the time or doing drugs probably have some unaddressed underlying issue. We are living the leeches and bleedings age of mental health, brothers, and it is rough out there. And unfortunately, a lot of people like us kill themselves before they ever get a chance to sort it out.  So, in my mind, whatever gets you through the night is alright. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, don't waste any time in trying to find professionals who can help you figure it out. At least that way you will know if you are drinking because you want to or because you need to.	&gt;e are living the leeches and bleedings age of mental health newlinechar  newlinechar I say this all the time, amen.

How much of that has gone into New York mobsters pockets who control the construction industry?	Personally I have no experience with organized crime, project I've been involved with are too high profile or affiliated with public agencies, though I know people who have. I don't know how prevalent organized crime still is, but typically they'll demand to put on a few workers on payroll who don't actually exist and collect their pay. Contractors can make upwards of $150 an hour so this adds up quickly

To be clear, is the accent you are referring to be something like [Tim Gunn's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=_n0OyaqpHa0#t=12) speech? newlinechar  newlinechar 	Yea, more or less.

Yep. No clue what was going through his head when he e'd into turtle 1v4 and ended up getting chunked to half and blowing his flash.

Have you played (or even seen) a game called hit man? Quite literally about an assassin, modern day.  newlinechar  newlinechar Whether you like that game or not it clearly shows you could have a modern day setting for an assassin game.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also I believe that watchdogs will either be related to the assassins world or a dry run for a modern day assassin game	You're not getting it. Talking about Assassin's Creed assassins, you know. The ones that brawl like Altair, Ezio, and Connor. Even with all the changes, it's one of the things that make AC games what they are. Take it away and it quickly becomes Splinter Cell, Saboteur, Velvet Assassin, Wanted, MGS, etc. Hitman isn't really at all relevant because it's more about HOW you make the kill, doesn't really matter in AC.

&gt; For whatever reason, that was their choice, some people don't want to learn Linux, some people need Windows for compatibility with work software, others don't know any better. newlinechar  newlinechar You make a really good point.

And then when someone complains about viruses on their PC, one of the answers is almost always something along the lines of: 'Macs and Linux don't get viruses as much.' It's present on every side, whether it be PC vs. Mac or Mac vs. Linux or Linux vs. PC. newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously, I wish those types of people would just get off their high horse and just help someone/answer a question when someone makes an honest inquiry (if they can). And if they can't answer it, either ignore the thread or just be kind and help them search for an answer instead of being unhelpful or an overall asshat.	I'm totally with you there. Operating systems are tools like any other, and some operating systems (and the software available for them) are better for different tasks. If I were asking for a screw driver, you wouldn't offer me a shovel. So why do the same when it comes to software and OSs?

Yes I am. I saw things that night that will stay with me until I die. I've tried to block the memories out of my head, but I haven't been able to do it. I remember seeing a woman unhinge her jaw and bite the head off of an obese man with a ponytail and an Undertaker shirt on. Her mouth must have opened at least a foot. There was blood everywhere!

Honest question: Which has more money earned? Because I certainly don't measure 'biggest game' by hours played, but by profits earned. It could very well be LoL...

Well if you look closely, Bloodwater and Zuna died very fast. He was probably just trying to win the fight as they were very close to doing.

Terrorism has a set definition just like Communism and socialism because some people label everything as terrorist doesnt't make the concept of terrorism any less concrete.

What is spoons? 	This was from one of the top Google search results I found: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Take one denomination of card from the deck for each player. Eg. If there are 5 players, take the Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, and 10's from the deck. If there are 12 players, use the whole deck. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Get a spoon for every player except one. Eg. if there are 6 players, get 5 spoons. Place the spoons on the table. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Deal out all of the cards. Everyone picks up their cards, and then the dealer starts calling 'Pass!'. When s/he says pass, each player must take one card from their hand and pass it to the left. The dealer can also say 'Pass right' or whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It works best if the dealer calls this every 3-4 seconds, so no one really has a chance to relax with their cards. This continues until someone gets four-of-a-kind, and then that player grabs a spoon and puts down their cards. All the other players then have to grab for a spoon, the loser being the one left out. If two players grab a spoon and neither lets go, the one holding the large end wins. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Loser must drink to pre-defined rules. Suggested rules are drinking for the number of seconds as the denomination of the winning 4-of-a-kind, or else polishing off their whole drink. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's an alternate source of information: newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoons

Just bought it, headed home now, already feeling the excitement of a new FF game	You'll probably have a bit of trouble getting online with it after installing to be honest. I personally wish I'd waited a week or so to pick it up. There's a super high volume of players online and most na/eu worlds are most likely going to be full up for a few hours yet. I'm having a blast with the game when I can actually play it though

Maybe, but you also have to consider they're playing against Kentucky, who's trying to run the Air Raid offense with personnel that just aren't meant for that type of offense.	Ah.

Well if it's snowing of course on hand is on the steering wheel. The other could be holding a cup of coffee, or alternatively an ipod/cellphone. But generally in winter I keep both hands on the wheel. newlinechar  newlinechar In the summer however, I usually eat some ice cream or whatever when biking, so it's nice to be able to brake with my feet.	Fair enough. I'm mostly bicycling to work myself. But the terrain here and the traffic makes me far to paranoid to do anything but bicycling when I'm bicycling. Then again, I currently live in a place where I can be terrified of walking so there is that.
If you've ever driven in heavy traffic on narrow freeways you'll know that sometimes you just can't leave any space. There's a rule I learned growing up in Houston - If you give them space, they'll take it. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: Many of you seem to misunderstand. In heavy traffic there is no where to go, if you let them you'll be bumper to bumper with both the merging car and the car behind you. It's better to leave just under a car length than let him in and be stuck with a foot and a half on both bumpers.	I have driven in NYC all my life. People here drive like aggressive assholes. I make a point to leave enough room between me and the car in front. If someone merges into that gap then you slow down and leave enough room between that car now. There's just no valid excuse for following too closely.
Fantastic shot! Thank you so much for sharing. 	You're welcome! 
The Bandit card in the rogue deck says it whenever you play it.	Also, if you combo the card (which you're most likely doing) it will summon a 2/1 bandit who follows up with a 'Yeah, beat it!'.

While it is legal, it's constitutionality is questionable and to my knowledge the courts have never made a ruling on the War Powers Act. I believe the constitutional requirement of a declaration of war was intended to prevent a president from having the power to unilaterally make war and the 60 day limit only stops a president from continuing a war they already made.	Warpowers act was intended for defensive war or if congress was somehow incapacitated. IMO Syria shouldn't qualify in any way under the act as there is absolutely no danger to the US or its allies.

As someone who bought this during Alpha launch, I fully understand how long it will take for updates and patches to be released. Anyone who complains about not getting new content is moron - but besides the point, Wollay (the creator) is INCREDIBLY distant with his player base and really don't let us know what's going on at all. newlinechar  newlinechar When Minecraft was in Alpha transitioning to Beta, Notch was constantly writing stuff they were working on from his Twitter feed, and giving expected dates etc. Even a MENTION of problems the game had would be good.  newlinechar  newlinechar I really want Cube World to be awesome, even for the Alpha its super promising and I've put well 40+ hours into it already, but Wallay should definitely be more supportive and welcoming to the people who spent the cash to fund his project.	All this kerfuffle is probably the reason Wollay waited so long to monetize the game. Can't say I'd enjoy being hounded by the intertubes either!  newlinechar  newlinechar Paid alpha's gonna be paid alphas.
No, ha, but I did get invited to dinner at the CFO's house and have one of the best references a person could ask for.	Awesome, I'm glad they appreciated you for it.
Can you not use old childhood photos belonging to a male officer? Or if they have to be very specific, get a minor to be in them and wait for them to come of age and consent to their use?

Bluntly, none of that means squat.  His recanting means nothing. His confession means nothing.  And quite frankly, I think the evidence means nothing.  Seriously, it was a war zone, how much evidence of who threw what grenade does anyone think there was lying around to be collected? newlinechar  newlinechar And really, is there a single person who thinks that if he threw the grenade then he should rot in prison, but if not he should never have been in jail at all? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 	That's true. Peter Worthington wrote a good article on the subject. newlinechar  newlinechar Essentially he argues that regardless of whether or not he is a child, it was a war zone, and he was defending his territory, or something to that effect. People aren't punished for standard acts of war after the war has ended. newlinechar  newlinechar [Khadr is not a traitor -- Peter Worthington](http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/27/khadr-is-not-a-traitor)  newlinechar  newlinechar At most, Khadr should have been held as a POW until the war was over, and then let go.

Alright, call my dad a liar. newlinechar  newlinechar I have much more proof that a plane hit than you do that a JASSM missile hit.

I spared you the excoriation of going through you youtube links one at a time.   Go see for  yourself about  newlinechar  newlinechar TinaCart's video, the first one you linked.   newlinechar  newlinechar Notice the video starts out with the filmers bringing your attention that a plane is about to enter the screen, but keep the camera focused on the towers the whole time.  The camera is not focused on the burning North Tower, but as if they know something's about to come in from the left of the screen.  The location is approx 2.35 miles from the WTC and explosion sound should take approx 11 sec to be heard by the camera, however you can hear the explosion right after the plane disappears into the South Tower. Notice how 'over-acting' the people heard in the background sound (Notice the scream of the women is also heard in the WNBC shot).  Someone passes their arm in front of the lens and later walks in front of the camera as if to 'prove' the footage is real.  These 'amateur' filmers also caught the WTC 1 collapse which you can only hear the women's voice scream, but not as frantic as in the WTC 2 crash video.  Also this video looks very similar to the Robert Clark photos and looks to have only aired once on TV.

Powerpuff Girls is loaded with references and things not only suitable for kids. Like the Cartmen reference or HIM who is a freaking devil transvestite!

Lauren Faust helped creat PPG and created MLP, one or two of the main writers wrote for PPG and Tara Strong who voiced Bubbles does the voice of the protagonist in MLP, also for a villian they had John DeLancie voice a character named Discord, a chaos spirit, it was basically the same exact role he played in Star Trek the next generation as Q, and while Pony is definitely no where near as violent as PPG well that was a pretty damn violent show you have to admit, even Samurai jack only ever killed robots, trust me MLP: FiM is a lot more like PPG than it would sound at first, you just have to ignore all the old lame, stupidly girly MLP stuff.

It's a mechanism to increase page views.  One of the metrics sites use for determining ad slot prices is how many people click through more than one site on the page before going elsewhere.

How would that be feasible? You'd have to scrap the use of names and refrain from allowing images of candidates to be released...

Well, technically speaking, the NFL actually is a charity. That's why you only get to see Goodell's salary, and not the league's books. It's also very nice for tax purposes.	No, they're technically a nonprofit.

For example: public colleges are non-profit but I doubt anyone would call them charities. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Wikipedia tells me that charities fit under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and my guess is NFL is under 501(c)(6) as a 'Business League'. newlinechar  newlinechar [Confirmed on the NFL's Wikipedia page, except trade organization not business league.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL#Corporate_structure)

Hussie died only because LE broke the 'fifth wall,' or rather, LE walked through the already-broken fifth wall. The wall is apparently not a part of the narrative contained on the discs.

How far ahead are you looking when you bike? The biggest problem I encounter when trying to teach people how to ride is that they want to constantly look down at the shifters or the front tire. newlinechar  newlinechar Riding a bike is like walking or driving, you have to look forward and let a lot of your sense do the balancing/driving for you. newlinechar  newlinechar That being said make sure the bike is properly fitted, it can be hard to achieve the right fit these days because of the varying style of bikes and I've seen it cause more problems than anything with new riders and an improperly fitted bike can easily cause balancing issues.
You're very welcome.	:)
Wouldn't a sports bra work? Those are generally larger and not quite as 'cutting' for lack of a better term.	Wouldn't a sports bra cover more surface of the tattoo than the normal bra? 
Hey dude. I think you look great here.  newlinechar  newlinechar Just a couple of things... How tall are you? Did you place? What would you do differently for your next show?	I'm 5' 7'' (manlet status engage) but look to push a whopping 5' 7.5' ;) newlinechar  newlinechar I took fourth in this (taken 2nd in two other pro-qualifying shows). The guy who won my class won the overall and his procard. Honestly, the lightweights were the most competitive class, IMO, and if the dude with dreadlocks weren't there the second place guy would have won his class and probably his pro card. Actually, I found out later the winner was already an IFPA pro, as well as a MuscleMania pro too. Makes me feel a little better.  newlinechar  newlinechar If I knew what I know now, I would have stuck with my 24 hour carb load just prior to the show, rather than starting a slower carb load a few days out, as well as not even try sodium loading this time. It seems to screw over tons of people. Oh well, live and learn.   newlinechar  newlinechar I mean really, it looks like I gained 2% bodyfat back overnight! I wish I had pics from a few days prior so you could see, but hindsight is 20/20.  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, I wanted to do my own prep this time, as I had hired someone in the past, but after struggling with balancing this, a full time job, getting engaged, etc. I've decided I'm definitely going to use a prep coach next time. Let them do my diet and cardio stuff so I don't have to worry about it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Hope that answers your questions. Hope to see you posting pics soon!  newlinechar  newlinechar 
I don't thinks it's about shared interests as much as it is voting for someone you believe to have your interests in mind.	thats what i meant, but i couldn't say it right.
Both the dog and the cop got ripped, everyone went to Denny's afterwards.	This is clearly the correct answer.
What should he have done? Looks like both his arms were trapped.	Not immediately rolled over to his back. A lot of people use the arm in guillotine with butterfly hooks to roll someone over like that, but Magnus didn't even have the butterfly hooks. I have no idea why Hamman rolled to his back so easily.
Did you stop in Saint John at all? That's where I am. I also see you enjoyed Fundy National Park as well. 	We went through saint john on the way in. Fundy park was a neat place to ride through. The road was big, straight and empty looking.

Doesn't look like a fat baby to me	I went from 99th percentile weight at birth to less than 10th percent as an adult, all normally healthy along the way. Genetics certainly play their role but fat doesn't magically manifest itself out of thin air. You have to eat *a lot* to get that fat.

If the victim isn't worried enough about it to stick around for the cops, why would the worry? newlinechar  newlinechar Makes sense to me.	The accident could have caused amnesia or a concussion, resulting in odd or bizarre behavior.  newlinechar  newlinechar It does sound like the victim was either intoxicated or mentally unwell prior to causing an accident, but for the police to throw their hands up and say 'oh, well' is criminal. 
Oh god I know. Kids are ridiculously expensive. My first nephew is due on the 30th, so I've been spending my make-up money on the most adorable little babygrows and stuff.

I never agreed to this understanding of everyone is equal. Everyone should have equal chances - yep, absolutely newlinechar everyone IS equal - nop, just not true newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure if there would be war, but somehow the engineered would certainly push the unengineered aside, like evolution always did. Killing them or treating them anyway else, aside from because they are not as good in some ways would be wrong, but if they would die out at some point because they got replaced by something better, so be it. (That sounds more harsh then I want it to be, but it's my best shot at trying to express myself right now)	&gt;Everyone should have equal chances - yep, absolutely everyone IS equal - nope, just not true newlinechar  newlinechar Why do you believe so? What's your interpretation of 'being equal'?
Is there anywhere I can stream 1.0 ? 	Legally? Probably not, you just might have to torrent it.
How can it be a unanimous decision against Kang when he basically dominated 2 rounds and most of 3rd as well? newlinechar 	He won the first round, lost the second and the third could've gone either way. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally I had him down as the winner, but that was a fight where either fighter could've walked away with the decision with how close it was. newlinechar

Trichinosis isn't even that huge of a concern with pork anymore (at least not in the US). Farmers aren't allowed to feed uncooked meat to hogs anymore, and a lot of pork sold commercially is frozen before being sold. Freezing pork kills the cysts, so if you don't want to overcook it just freeze and thaw the cut beforehand then cook to whatever your preferred temperature is.	Very good point, from what I understand the only cases of trichinosis in the US in recent years were from wild game, but still, I guess it's technically possible some meat could still be unsafe at low temps. I don't know that I'd advocate freezing because it could mar the texture and lose some moisture though.
Could I get a tutorial on how to make those faces? I guess I missed the memo. newlinechar 	Find the proper characters in the character map, then copy and paste them.
Who would you want on production duties for that?	Oh shit, this is a hard one. Since it's already an all-star cast, I would want a grab-bag of amazing producers. Gimme two beats by El-P, a few by Mike Will for mainstream appeal, maybe a few by Clams to keep things druggy, two more electronic beats by FlyLo, one or two by Sounwave to keep things TDE, and finally, one amazing Lex Luger beat. I'm talking the hardest shit he's ever done. Last track on the album.
no one dies because of lucid dreaming. Sometimes your subconscious attempts to inform you of things. It can be spooky, but you're not going to be breaking mirrors if you keep in mind that there is nothing that can harm you, and nothing needs to scare you. When things you can't control happen this is a good indicator that you are moving into a greater level of perception. You are no longer creating whatever you wish to see, and are beginning to see aspects of yourself. Lucid dreaming is not simply a fun way to dream... it goes a lot deeper than that. 	That time I broke a mirror and ended up with fists full of blood. What would happen the next time? That's why I'm not taking the risk.
Card filter, consistency, fight mechanic, draws away the damage. This card goes well well going into midrange. It grows into an immediate threat regardless of heavy creatures. If its not putting creatures in my hand, its getting rid of the creatures on the field. It's good regardless of lacking creatures in my deck, ( in almost any deck), in my opinion. newlinechar 	Domri Rade is not good in this deck.
Xthreshial with the clutch hooks on Ezreal. Regi with the manliest Ahri I've ever seen. Oddone alaays seemed to be in the right place. Man, I feel like everyone stepped up. 	Everyone on TSM played really well tbh.
Go fuck yourself, seriously. Preferably with your miniature Cloud figurine.	Lmao what? I don't even play FF besides this game, fucktard.
God, Immortal Iron Fist was so good. But was it not also written by Brubaker?	I believe the first arc was co-written with Ed Brubaker. Ed already had five picks on my lists though.

Sometimes, if the art is old enough, they have to give it new art. It's something about the way they used to handle the art process. That's why sometimes you see new art for cards in duels of the planeswalkers, even if those cards aren't getting reprinted.	yes but they have said expansion sets will always have new art 100% of the time

You asked why we should help, I'm giving you that side of the argument, at least acknowledge there is a reason to help. 	There is zero reason to help.

Could you go into depth about it?	My friend told me to hold his backpack in 6th grade. He ran. Cops came around corner and saw me with backpack. Shoved me up against wall, search bag, and found pot. I go by my motto:Snitches get stitches but they caught him anyway after they brought me to the PD.
I hear you.  We just need consistency from the players we have - but how do we get that? Better managing?  Better coaching? Player meetings where someone stands up and challenges everyone to be stand up and do what they are capable of? I understand everyone's frustration with Dusty, and I myself don't think he's a particularly good manager, But he's not the guy out there on the field not getting the key base hit, or the key out, or the key defensive play.  Mostly everyone seems to be doing a good job, but somehow it isn't good enough.  How can you feel good about your post season chances when you are the 3rd best team in your own division?	If the only responsibility of the manager is to set the lineup and set up the bullpen, then we should just replace Dusty with a computer.
Yes. Quite effectively.	Hmm, can this kill you? 
OP is obviously french and must smell like elderberries.	I think also his mother was a hamster

That's true. Peter Worthington wrote a good article on the subject. newlinechar  newlinechar Essentially he argues that regardless of whether or not he is a child, it was a war zone, and he was defending his territory, or something to that effect. People aren't punished for standard acts of war after the war has ended. newlinechar  newlinechar [Khadr is not a traitor -- Peter Worthington](http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/27/khadr-is-not-a-traitor)  newlinechar  newlinechar At most, Khadr should have been held as a POW until the war was over, and then let go.	Ah, but there's one group of people this defence won't work for: Canadian citizens.

There have been very very few fights in WoW that in their fixed form could kill you without you having a chance no matter what. In that sense any WoW fight could be seen as beatable on the first try, which matches your definition. This is what I already thought, which simply leads to the question I'm asking; when compared to different WoW raid fights, where will the top end difficulty lie? In a spot that top 50 world guilds will blow through? Or fights that top 3000 world guilds will blow through?	How will Carbine know that though?  How do you quantify that?  How do you qualify that?  Even better yet, how does Carbine communicate that? newlinechar  newlinechar You are sort of asking an impossible question to answer.  The only way Carbine could ever really solve it is to invite these top raiders in to try and play their game, but even then Wildstar is such a vastly different game from WoW mechanically that it might not even be something you can test effectively until those guilds got some time to familiarize themselves with the game for an extended period of time. newlinechar  newlinechar Not to mention, considering the way Carbine has talked about their design tools (as a tools designer myself they sound pretty impressive), I doubt difficulty will be hard to adjust after the fact.  If the super hardcore raiders get in and blow through everything too fast, Carbine can adjust their content in the future to ensure those people are happy.  It is one of the benefits of running an MMO where the game is so actively supported at launch (which is the reason why Carbine decided to make it a sub fee game, to ensure that support is top-notch). newlinechar  newlinechar Also, considering the time until release, it is very possible Carbine isn't even actually sure where they lie on the raid content.  I would be surprised if any of the end-game content is anything but first or second pass right now.  Carbine has said they want to make hard content at max level, so I imagine that unless they make a huge mistake, it will be hard in their eyes.  However, challenge is subjective and hard to quantify and qualify, so we don't really know what that means until we get our hands on it.

I'm hoping that they won't actually need to do much to prove that he wasn't involved. It was a sting, the cops have been watching this guy for a while, my SO and the guy with all the drugs have never even met. It'll be very easy to prove that he wasn't involved other than taking his friend over there

Can confirm I have a Mexican fianceÃ©	my kids mother and my current gf are the only caucasian women i was ever in a long-term relationship with. i've dated dominican, puerto rican, and black women for the most part. and i'm white. i think it's due to growing up in north philly. i was a minority there for sure. the love of my life was a puerto rican girl i've known since i was 8. lost her to an od about 9 yrs ago.....she was the one.

Ever since the pdd's rumble at allstars, he got back into rumble. Allstars was a real eye opener. Also his 2v1 when he played yorick vs balls rumble opened his eyes on rumble's strength. 	I don't agree with that. Dyrus has consistantly played Rumble very well throughout both splits, he's gotten better yes, but he's always been one of the biggest proponents of Rumble.

Yep Zuna stood on that equalizer and almost died just to that

Ah, but there's one group of people this defence won't work for: Canadian citizens.  (Well also US, British and citizens of other coalition countries). newlinechar  newlinechar So Mr. Kadhr's Afghan allies weren't traitors to Canada. newlinechar  newlinechar But Mr. Kadhr is Canadian and siding with the enemy is treason.  That makes Mr. Kadhr a traitor.	That argument is in the article by Worthington.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you look at Khadr's history, he was born in Canada, and shipped out at something like 2 years old. He is only Canadian by loose association, really. On top of that, even though treason doesn't have an age limit (that I know of), I can't really see someone logically arguing that a, effectively brainwashed, 15 year old can commit treason.
Bullshit. I guarantee that if these were said by someone you respect you'd be defending them and saying that people who don't appreciate them simply don't understand the deeper meaning or whatever.

to be fair, clg played so much better.	CLG's first game was better than Vulcan's first game. Vulcan's second game was better than CLG's second game. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that sums it up a bit better. newlinechar  newlinechar Vulcan was almost perfect even with TSM 2nd game, but lost because of one small mistake of fighting at baron before mancloud could get there. Even though mancloud was late he could have cleaned up if Turtle didn't take down targets perfectly like he did. Much closer than CLG's game 2. 
I wonder why people downvote these comments? No sense of humor?  Or just a similar experience? newlinechar  newlinechar No great comment goes undownvoted.	Some of those downvotes are most likely from the fuzzing reddit does automatically to counteract bots.

Is Cheshire really that good and that close to earl grey? I've been wanting to try it but don't want to be disappointed by the scent. 	I think it's really quite close to the real thing. I haven't tried other soaps like this, but when I looked around for other people's opinions, they said most others aren't this close. Don't judge the smell until you've lathered it! The soap itself is quite soft. I cut the puck in half and mashed one half into the bottom of my mug. The lather itself is really luxurious. They say it's 'thirsty', but that's not a big deal. It lathers quickly and abundantly. At $11, I say go for it. Or get a sampler. When mine arrived, it came with a sample of Seville, but I haven't given it a go yet.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've only tried a handful of soaps because I only got into wetshaving this past summer (TOBS grapefruit, col conk, and QCS Iced Key Lime), and I daresay this is my new favorite.

Minecraft?	It's multiplayer is not streamlined enough, it's not free, and it doesn't utilize F2P tactics to prolong play. Also its social features are too basic. newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine a game that combines the widespread appeal of WoW, LoL, and farmville; that's along the lines of what will bring in enormous numbers. It has to be an easily accessible online game that encourages players to not only log on to play for a bit today, but also tomorrow and *next week*. Daily quests in WoW do this turn WoW into a habit that enables interaction with online friends, League of Legends continuously provides purchasable content and changes the free rosters periodically, and Farmville is literally built into a social network site where playing it is as easy as checking facebook. Those sound like horrible things to seasoned gamers, but they're incredibly good at amassing enormous playerbases and tapping into the casual market.

If you're not planning on using the 3D function often, or at all, I'd wait for the 2DS. It's going to be cheaper, and compatible with the 3DS library. Otherwise, I'd still recommend getting a 3DS.

How does being the appropriate distance away, rather than too close, block your view? The closer you are the worse view you have. The point is that if you maintain a sufficient gap, then even if the car in front of you stops instantaneously then you can safely react and brake without hitting it. If the car in front of you has to slam on the brakes, then you won't need the full amount of stopping distance because you have their breaking distance *plus* the gap you're leaving in which to stop. But if they suddenly swerve out of the way of a crashed, stationary vehicle and you have to brake, then you need to have left a sufficient distance or you're going to hit it.	Sounds like the guy changed lanes and then noticed the traffic in that lane was stopped,  that would fuck with you,

He brought in his own music asking us to play it while he was there. I was fine with it because I enjoyed the jazz music he brought in but the girls were pretty offended so we rarely play it.

I don't understand these people. So somehow Monsanto is a bunch of evil geniuses, but at the same time ignorant of basic science? I'm currently operating under the assumption that because people like that poster are idiots they assume everyone else is too.  newlinechar  newlinechar When I was in college I was a lab tech in the entomology department of a Monsanto research laboratory. Everyone from the lowest research associate on up had at least a master's degree in entomology, and there were a few phds in the department. Oddly enough, they knew how resistance develops, and were intimately involved in creating strategies to deal with it.  newlinechar  newlinechar BT resistance is a major issue, but there's nothing unique about the problem it poses.  Managing resistance is something that integrated pest management folks have been dealing with for ages.	I can't figure out how glyphosate would kill a rootworm...
But what if it was just a courtesy smile, and she doesn't like me?? 	What ifs can't prevent pain in life.  We try, but pain happens.  If there is going to be pain, make sure you take risks where you get the biggest payoff.  The chance to get to know someone better, maybe even find love and companionship, is always worth the risk of asking the hard questions. newlinechar  newlinechar The way I see it, you will find out when you try talking to her.  Then you know and it's always good to find out and know for sure, rather than simply avoiding her and never even take the risk. Talking to her is fact finding, to see what her intention is, if she has intentions.   newlinechar  newlinechar If her smile was just habit and not intentionally trying to get your attention, don't take her rejection personally.  She doesn't even know you to reject you, the person.  She has her reasons and is allowed to like and feel attracted to whomever she wants.   newlinechar  newlinechar Rejection feels so personal, but it really can't be, since she doesn't even know you.  That's why it's always better to take the risk in the beginning.  You win some and you lose some.  You are playing the odds, knowing you will eventually find someone who was worth all the previous risk.  
We don't speak of those years.	What years?
I understand. I have raised two kids, and a measured, controlled non-vindictive approach to spanking worked for me and my wife. We spanked our kids when they were too young to reason with--not when we were angry; not enough to really cause pain, just a couple reasonably light smacks on a clothed bottom worked wonders. I respect that other parents do not choose this as an option; I do. But when the child isn't old enough to comprehend reasoning and is oppositional, it is a perfectly workable option, because it's not the pain that convinces them to do what you want--it is the shock of, 'I just got hit!?!' That puts them off of whatever oppositional stance they had taken and they comply. BUT I never spanked with anything other then a hand, never on an unclothed bottom, and never never never out of anger. Some parents spank to relieve the anger they feel--that's not a good reason to spank a child. Just my two cents--I hope your situation improves, and the best of luck to you and your family.	I like that this is a 'non-traditional- approach to spanking. I'm glad you found something that works for your family. Thank you for your advice :)

I saved it as an *attacker*.  	oh...how did I not realize that
No, I don't have control AND I have no interest in wielding what minor spin I might have on the outcome. Even if I did take it upon myself to boss everyone else around, the outcome would still be determined on how willing and able they would be to be bossed. Keep in mind that with overflow servers and the such the majoirty of players on that server either won't even be participating in the event or won't be interested in doing so like a cog in a machine. 	Right, it is well known at this point you have no interest in it. That is fine as others will. You can either join up still, and try and take on the tasks needed to make the encounter succeed, or just ignore it. Overtime as servers begin to succeed at the event because people try to coordinate, other players  will learn what needs to be done, and learn to recognize when something isn't being done based on the bosses status. As players learn the encounter, even overflow servers will be capable of doing it, as they will be composed of players who have learned it from their primary server through chance alone.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's like anything in game that is challenging at fist. You learn it, and you pick up on what needs to be done. There will be ebbs and flows as experienced players tire of the event and drop out, but new players will take up the task of learning it. And best of all, for you, there are still places in the world to get rewarded by mindlessly pressing the 1 key.

I was positive that I had read that the pH of skin was naturally between 4.5 and 5.5. I went to look it up and [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489300) says the average natural pH for skin is 4.7, so unpasturized ACV is fairly close.	Cool to know.  The danger is probably more so for mucus membranes and tooth enamel, or maybe just sensitive skin. I know when I used it on my wart it also left the healthy skin around it looking a bit raw.  Of course, that was with it soaked in it overnight. I'm just saying be careful with the amount of use, especially in OP's case where she's saying it causes pain.

I'm tired of people in this thread pretending like they're above this. You know just as well as anyone that having 9 partners in the same night is irresponsible.

You're asking a lot of a person for them to pretend like this is ok behavior. They're going to question whether or not one partner is satisfying, if they should be checked, and deeply question the relationship. It will most likely be hard to hold down a serious relationship if you participate in acts like this. Not to mention, if you're in high school, social interactions will be strained and you will be judged.

I'm thinking this would be possible by injecting assembly into the game. I watched IE6's videos on GameCube shenanigans (good watch!) and there's something that gets called when you die (which decreases your stock count).  Should be only one changed/added to change character ID, but I'm not sure if needing to load new textures or anything would make it not work. I'll take a peek at it later tonight or tomorrow if I have time! 	I asked the good folks developing Project M about it back before 2.6 was released, and I was told that 'the technology just isn't there right now.' Considering all the stuff they've done with assembly, I'm inclined to trust them, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. If you can crack it, your name will be sung throughout the ages.

I don't understand how accepting being fat helps fix it. Support in losing weight helps, acceptance - dont think so	Because acceptance that the person is a person first is invaluable. Often, support is actually shaming and nagging about the weight, which inspires negativity and further weight gain. newlinechar  newlinechar Fat acceptance is about dropping the judgment and assumptions and just accepting fat people as people. We can all see we are fat and can choose to improve our health or not in whatever way we see fit. Unless a person asks you for help with his or her perceived problem (be it financial woes or weight troubles or junk food consumption or whatever), you generally shouldn't bring it up. Doing so says you don't accept or love the person as is.

I was told when I single crochet to skip the first stitch when I turn, so that was wrong? What I do is chain however many  then I turn and skip the first stitch, then continue my row. Does that make sense? I'm not very good about terminology yet. 	I never said that. I said you have to put your final stitch in the turning chain or your row will be a stitch short. But typically the turning chain does not count in single crochet (don't skip a stitch) but does for the rest of the stitches. Make sure you count your stitches, that'll keep you from shortening your rows.

You're not getting it. Talking about Assassin's Creed assassins, you know. The ones that brawl like Altair, Ezio, and Connor.

Firstly, I love the art. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, and more importantly, I think the card is iiiinteresting. I think it's a bit overpowered in a bunch of cases, but it is very situation dependent. The major issue is that it's mostly going to be used on your opponent's turn. SO, it restarts that player's turn. That's okay, maybe. It also exiles all spells on the stack, and counters uncounterables, which would be a little bit annoying.  newlinechar  newlinechar It also opens up a lot of ability for interesting plays. Let's say your opponent sphinxes up to 15 cards in hand and you upkeep this. That's a 3 mana discard 8. Situationally dependent, but strong. It breaks off post-combat kill spells. It shuts off a lot of your opponent's ability make plays, and thereby is kiind of an unfun card. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, at worst, it's a counterspell that let's them untap, costed the same as cancel, with a good amount of ability for interesting play. newlinechar  newlinechar Probably broken.	In general, I don't feel that it's overpowered. I agree that there are a few niche uses that can be very good, as well as the ability to counter uncounterables or stop storm. However, restarting the turn means, like you said, they untap and more importantly, draw a card to replace what was 'countered.'  newlinechar  newlinechar The sphinx to 15 scenario I find unlikely to happen, only because they are almost certain after drawing so many cards to have a counterspell in hand to prevent their turn from ending. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for the feedback!

What color would you recommend for hair. And yes, my boyfriend has recommended muscle gain, since he's been working on that himself lately. (=
Except Moses isn't all that great. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: It's the truth. Everyone here always thinks a player is sunshine and rainbows when they move teams. He's incredibly raw as a player, and Liverpool only have him for one season where he's not going to become a superstar overnight. 	People said that about Sturridge.
Ah. I don't know much about them this year. I just know WKY was decent last year, and now have Petrino. So I'm wary of them.	True, but they lost their 2012 QB and leading receiver from last year. They have a pretty good back in Antonio Andrews but a young defensive line that our offensive line should dominate.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't wanna discount Western Kentucky in any way, and Petrino is a proven asset, but I think this is more Kentucky being Kentucy than it is anything else. Also keep in mind this is Mark Stoops' first year as a head coach ever so that's another unknown in that game.
He's back up and jogging well now.	Thank you. I'm watching on a stream with no sound.

I'm searching for something spiritual, I guess.  I want to test the worth of experiences instead of possessions.	I know a few traveler kids.

Omelettes, quiches and the like all freeze quite well.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'd suggest thawing rather than tossing them straight into the microwave frozen as if bits overcook while you're trying to get the whole thing up to temperature, it'll get rather rubbery. newlinechar  newlinechar Ham, sausage and cheese are good fillings. Bacon will remain tasty but lose its crunch. Potato will get mealy so avoid. Greens and onions are good for vegetables. Tomatoes won't do as well. 	Thank you very much! newlinechar When you say greens are you talking about leafy greens like spinach and such? (sorry I'm from a non-English speaking country so I just want to make sure I'm understanding you) newlinechar  newlinechar Are bell peppers and broccoli ok for this? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, should I use milk in the mixture or will it get soggy or strange after thawing if I do that? newlinechar  newlinechar One more thing, how should I freeze them? just put them in a freezer box straight from the oven or let them cool some/completely first? newlinechar  newlinechar Again, thank you so much for your reply :)

&gt; Out of all the studies I presented, I thought only one relied on vignettes but it was actually two, and that makes me a liar?  newlinechar  newlinechar I think it makes you disingenuous.  It was you who mentioned Sadalla.  You claimed that your sources debunked Sadalla, and maybe.  The point I'm speaking to is that the methodology used in the studies which debunk really doesn't say anything at all because attraction isn't a rational thought process.  Reading a vignette and then asking a series of questions is a rational process.  Trying to understand something that is more instinctual than rational through a purely rational process?  If you pull the other one, it plays show-tunes. newlinechar  newlinechar And truth be told, I'm aware of several ways that science is manipulated, I believe it's called confirmation bias.   newlinechar  newlinechar So we have a number of studies which don't really say much of anything about attraction, because attraction isn't rational. newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, some guys still wanna get laid, and you know what?  If they wait around for the science to be settled, they might as well be waiting for the 2nd comming.  Thankfully for them, there's other evidence to consider.  What have the two hottest selling series of novels in women's literature been in the past say, five years?  The Twilight Series, and the Fifty Shades of Grey series, and the latter is all about sexual surrender to a dominant, high-status man.   newlinechar  newlinechar And it's not like they don't have their predecessors, perhaps you've heard of a little company known as Harlequin Enterprises?   newlinechar  newlinechar If you want TRP to believe that dominance doesn't have a place in the attraction picture, or doesn't have a place in an effective strategy then perhaps you should have a word with western women, because it sure looks to me like they didn't get the memo.	&gt;I think it makes you disingenuous. newlinechar  newlinechar If *I'm* disingenuous, then the fact that you made far more numerable and egregious errors, then what would that make you? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It was you who mentioned Sadalla. You claimed that your sources debunked Sadalla, and maybe. newlinechar  newlinechar I mentioned Sadalla as that's the only paper that found an association between dominance and attractiveness - practically all other papers since it's publication in 1987 have refuted it. And *I* didn't claim that the papers debunked it, that was the explicit conclusion of a number of the papers. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The point I'm speaking to is that the methodology used in the studies which debunk really doesn't say anything at all because attraction isn't a rational thought process. Reading a vignette and then asking a series of questions is a rational process. Trying to understand something that is more instinctual than rational through a purely rational process? If you pull the other one, it plays show-tunes. newlinechar  newlinechar You understand that even if we accept that all of the papers relied on vignettes (they didn't, I'm not sure why you're still pushing this lie), the only single paper that supports your position also relied on vignettes.  newlinechar  newlinechar The point being that you are refuting the only possible scientific paper that supports your point of view. When we reject the Sadalla paper, then we're left with the other papers I linked to that didn't rely on vignettes, which means that my position is more reasonable. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I'd love to see evidence that this attraction to dominance is 'instinctual', especially since the concept of 'instinct' has long since been rejected from science. It's been over 20 years since any mainstream publication has discussed the concept. What used to be referred to as 'instinct' has now be divided up into more specific processes, and I don't think any of them would support the kind of thing you're pushing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And truth be told, I'm aware of several ways that science is manipulated, I believe it's called confirmation bias. newlinechar  newlinechar Interestingly, this is a common finding amongst people pushing pseudoscientific ideas - it's explained by the '[scientific impotence discounting hypothesis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00588.x/abstract)'. Basically, the finding is that when people defending pseudoscientific positions are presented with scientific facts that contradict their beliefs, instead of changing their beliefs they are much more likely to satisfy the cognitive dissonance by rejecting the scientific method itself.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So we have a number of studies which don't really say much of anything about attraction, because attraction isn't rational. newlinechar  newlinechar None of those studies rely on 'rational' processes.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That being said, some guys still wanna get laid, and you know what? If they wait around for the science to be settled, they might as well be waiting for the 2nd comming. newlinechar  newlinechar ...But the science is settled. There's no need to wait. Women aren't attracted to dominance. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Thankfully for them, there's other evidence to consider. What have the two hottest selling series of novels in women's literature been in the past say, five years? The Twilight Series, and the Fifty Shades of Grey series, and the latter is all about sexual surrender to a dominant, high-status man. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh yes, that's totally evidence. Luckily with objective evidence like best selling novels, we don't have to worry about things like confirmation bias or manipulation of evidence. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And it's not like they don't have their predecessors, perhaps you've heard of a little company known as Harlequin Enterprises? newlinechar  newlinechar Oh sweet, more evidence from books. You got me man, your books totally disprove science. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If you want TRP to believe that dominance doesn't have a place in the attraction picture, or doesn't have a place in an effective strategy then perhaps you should have a word with western women, because it sure looks to me like they didn't get the memo. newlinechar  newlinechar I'll have a look through Amazon.com and I'll come back when I have irrefutable evidence. I'm sorry I spent all that time presenting science, I didn't realise that objective facts aren't in vogue these days. 
How far ahead are you looking when you bike? The biggest problem I encounter when trying to teach people how to ride is that they want to constantly look down at the shifters or the front tire. newlinechar  newlinechar Riding a bike is like walking or driving, you have to look forward and let a lot of your sense do the balancing/driving for you. newlinechar  newlinechar That being said make sure the bike is properly fitted, it can be hard to achieve the right fit these days because of the varying style of bikes and I've seen it cause more problems than anything with new riders and an improperly fitted bike can easily cause balancing issues.	Honestly, because I'm so embarrassed about not being able to ride, I haven't even *tried* for years (great logic there, right?). So I couldn't answer any of our questions truthfully. But I'll definitely try your suggestions. I guess it'll eventually come out once we start teaching my son...

Well technically speaking nothing is implosion resistant, the structural design is significantly more effective than what's been employed in years past. The collapses on 9/11 were caused by the heating and weakening of the structural steal which was protected from by gypsum board and rudimentary fire-proofing which, in the explosion subsequent to the plane crashes, was blown off leaving the steel exposed to heat. The structural steel is protected this time round by 3-7ft thick concrete walls and 'explosion-proof' fireproofing.

If you choose to take a very reductive definition of 'ideology', then people who are interested in social justice do not have an ideology either: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Social justice in not an ideology. Are babies born with bigotry? No, they just simply are not bigots. if i observe no bigotry and use it to classify my belief its not an ideology, just like vewing things from my window is not an ideology. newlinechar  newlinechar However if you define 'ideology' in the context of differing groups of people, it certainly is, as is atheism. I really hate dictionary arguments, but on this I'll compromise:  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Definition of IDEOLOGY 2b noun 'a manner or the content of thinking characteristic of an individual, **group**, or culture newlinechar  newlinechar This seems to be an unimportant topic though, and I would prefer to address your central claims, so here are some questions: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Specifically, how does a group that is interested in both social justice and atheism appear less rational?  newlinechar 2. Does that appearance matter so much that we should exclude people who wouldn't want to join a group that welcomes racists and sexists? newlinechar 3. What should people do if they are tired of being harassed by 'fellow' atheists merely for disagreeing or criticizing with behavior withing the atheist/skeptic community? newlinechar  newlinechar **edit: This would probably be a clearer conversation if you would avoid adding large blocks to older statements and instead respond with them in the next reply.** newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Also social justice is not rational, its simply a nice thing to do. newlinechar  newlinechar Elaborate on that please, because that makes no sense. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Also, i dont see how how not focusing on social justice makes it any less welcoming to say, black people. in fact by including these social jsutice things you are basicly saying 'oh, we got this new kid here, hes a SPECIAL kid you have to treat him nicely' newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe the issue is that you don't understand social justice or are deliberately representing an obtuse example to make a point. To avoid the massive post editing, please clarify on this on your next response.	Oooops. This is why i edit my posts so much, change the social justice with atheism at the first part there. I feel bad as your arguments are correct and good.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, you appear less rational because you care less about if its the truth or not and more about the effects that come with atheism. The 5 value is critical thinking..(not number 1). You have different priorites, just admit it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ok, so lets get into what a skeptic is, its those that challenge how society and what the truth is. Its difficult to see you as skeptics, because althoguh you are atheists that are a minority, in this time being against racism, homophobia is quite normal. Being an atheist and thinking 'maybe black people are stupid' is way closer to being a skeptic. If you question what is common to think at the time, that is a skeptic. Social justice is able to be against skeptics.

That lists them by how much money they made in a year, not exactly a ranking of who is the 'number one DJ.' Even if you want to argue that the guy paid the most to DJ is the best DJ then you can't source that article, because in their figures they included royalties, music sales and endorsements. I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of the money Calvin Harris made was not from shows but from licensing his music to stadiums and commercials. Go to any football game or major sporting event and tell me how many times you here 'Feels so Close.' newlinechar  newlinechar Arguing about it is pretty fucking pointless anyway, it's entirely subjective. I'm not going to think that Calvin Harris is the best DJ because I wouldn't enjoy his shows based on his music and the crowd it attracts, conversely I saw RJD2 last year and was blown away and he's definitely the best DJ I've personally seen but not a lot of people would call him number one. So yea... not worth debating. 	ofcourse it's subjective, that's why I asked.

Those who receive the exaltation in the celestial kingdom will have the âcontinuation of the seeds forever.â They will live in the family relationship. In the terrestrial and in the telestial kingdoms there will be no marriage. Those who enter there will remain âseparately and singlyâ forever.

I was actually at the game, it was awesome!...for the first quarter. After that, GT just ran up the score. After the 3rd quarter, I felt bad for Elon. 3 pick-6's, 3 70+ yd runs, and many 15+ yd passes. 	They weren't inconsiderate, however. They played through their depth chart and agreed to a continuous clock in the 4th quarter to allow the game to end quicker. On their last drive they just ate the clock and took a knee instead of going for the TD. Elon was surely expecting a beating anyways.  newlinechar  newlinechar The dominant performance on both sides of the ball is encouraging for the coming weeks. I know Elon isn't nearly competitive, but GT's showing was  impressive nonetheless IMO.
First of all, thank you for replying seriously.  But I am concerned that even if corporations think this way now, they will not always think this way. I have a hard time believing that entities that exist to make money and power will turn down a way to make money and power. 	I try to remain serious and honest when possible on reddit, although the temptation to troll does sometimes overtake me. But I do agree that any entity that exists to make money or gain power is ultimately doomed to corruption. The question isn't whether corruption is there but to what extent, and from what I have seen and learned power corrupts faster than money, and right now the government is giving itself power at an alarming rate. Its not just the president, congress, or one department, but the government as a whole seems to be spiraling, grabbing power at any chance it sees, be it the NSA, IRS, EPA etc. While Microsoft and Google do have some power, they are vastly more limited in it. What corporations have is money, lots of it, but that money is more fluid in its corrupting abilities. They know they need to maintain a revenue stream, and consumers, if banded together, can have drastic effects on that revenue pushing corporations in the direction they want, or ending their existence out right. Obviously the bigger the corporation the more pushing is needed but its far easier to push corporations than governments. That is a more long winded explanation to my answer.  newlinechar  newlinechar To people who say 'well if you have nothing to hide' are being short sighted and missing the point. I have nothing to hide, I have gone through more extensive background checks than most people to include polygraphs with no issues, but I still don't want the government snooping around. It isn't that I am hiding anything, its a matter of principle and the road that leads down. Sure its just a privacy issue now but that can lead to some horrible stuff down the road. The last thing I want to see is a worst case scenario such as that of Nazi Germany where the government sends goons to 'remove' people who disagree. Do I think that will happen, probably not, but it is possible. What I think is likely though is using that information to restrict people further or even bully them into agreement. That isn't the place of the government. The government is supposed to work for the people, fear the people, and only carry out the will of the people, ***not ever*** the other way around. While I am sure you and I disagree on many political issues, that is one I believe we likely agree on.

We've played well against the Reds this year. Then we have the Pirates at home where we've had better luck against them.

How poorly the Pirates play in September. newlinechar  newlinechar If tomorrow truly is a comeback day, and we continue playing well, we could possibly come out of this division-series stretch tied for/in the lead in the Central.

So what if they have a genre of music of what they love? People like electronic music, classical, foreign, etc. but it is fine for them. As soon as Christianity is involved, it is suddenly a bad thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm just saying that just because someone likes a certian genre that you don't like, doesn't mean you should automatically be disgusted. 	Again, it's not the music that repels people. I can't stand pop and (most) rap music, but almost all of my friends listen to just that. newlinechar  newlinechar It's the fact that it's a 'genre' of music that is ENTIRELY ABOUT A RELIGION. Sure, other genres have certain 'themes' to them - a lot of rap talks about fucking bitches and money and whatnot, pop music is generally 'feelgood' stuff and things about love and cheese, rock is all angsty and 'fuck the system', etc, but there are songs about different things in those genres. You can rap about dinosaurs or whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar An entire fucking genre of music praising your religion is a bit much. People, as far as I'm aware, don't have the same reaction of 'Woah, weird O_o' to country music despite its religious undertones because it's usually much more subtle, and there is obviously much more to it than 'Jesus will save me'. newlinechar  newlinechar This is a creepy level of dedication. Nothing wrong with being a bit spiritual, but when your musical tastes and spirituality are synonymous...well. This says something about you, your spirituality is leaking too much into other aspects of your life. This complicates things. newlinechar  newlinechar First of all - assuming your partner doesn't share your views, they'd have to be careful to not say something touchy. Personally, this sounds really fucking annoying because your fuckbuddy should be somebody you feel comfortable discussing anything with. newlinechar  newlinechar Second - religions tend to have restrictions about lots of things, especially regarding fucking. Fucking is a pretty big part of relationships. Now it'd be pretty _fucking_ annoying to have Jesus cockblock you. newlinechar  newlinechar Third - Similar to first, but I split it so I'd have three points. It's a nice number. Anyways, it displays how vocal you are about your views (not necessarily a bad thing). However, many people who aren't religious have very different views of things than those who are - especially regarding things of a sexual nature.

I'm glad. It shows respect for Congress and the checks and balances we have in place for this sort of thing. The question is: if Congress tells him 'no', will he act anyway?

No, they're technically a nonprofit.

The style evolved, Neverwinter Nights 2 released its last expo in 2010 I think. They just stopped using isometrics because the graphics capabilties of mid-2000 systemes could handle full 3d geometry.

This is my problem with the criticism of Cosmo.

Cosmo could tell people to stick cattle prods up my bum, but it shouldn't matter because the deeper problem is people being unable to find out what their partners are into via communication in the first place.

You're so right, and I was so surprised that of all things, their strength in these sets would be their decisiveness due to the drama and just recent LCS performances where they weren't moving as one unit.

The main things you would be concerned about are bugs and light. If you wanted to extend your growing season, you would need massive amounts of light to continue the fruit growth of the plant (like a high pressure sodium light with at least 250 Watts). Also, there are probably all sorts of bugs living in the soil you are using from outdoors (aphids, mites, etc). You could try to use 'organic' pesticides, but it would only lessen the chances. You could try to take a cutting and keep that alive through winter, but bugs could still be a concern. 	You could probably move the plant/plants into a garage or somewhere isolated (bugs) to protect them from frost at night, then move them out during the day for light. That would prevent needing a big light, protect them, and probably add a couple weeks to your season.
Honestly, because I'm so embarrassed about not being able to ride, I haven't even *tried* for years (great logic there, right?). So I couldn't answer any of our questions truthfully.

I thought the guy got run over.	Nope; he was eventually pulled away by two unidentified men. newlinechar  newlinechar Quote from Wikipedia on the man's identity: newlinechar &gt; Little is publicly known of the man's identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid the Sunday Express named him as Wang Weilin (çç»´æ), a 19-year-old student who was later charged with 'political hooliganism' and 'attempting to subvert members of the People's Liberation Army'. However, this claim has been rejected by internal Communist Party of China documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights. One party member was quoted as saying, 'We canât find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but canât find him among the dead or among those in prison.' Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man's identity and current whereabouts. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President's Club in 1999, Bruce Herschensohn, former deputy special assistant to President Richard Nixon, reported that he was executed 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by firing squad a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests. In Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now, Jan Wong writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have 'no idea who he was either,' and that he's still alive, hiding in mainland China. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The government of the People's Republic of China has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, then-CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), 'I can't confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not,' and then replied in English, 'I think...never killed'. At the time, the party's propaganda apparatus referred to the incident as showing the 'humanity' of the country's military.

This was from one of the top Google search results I found: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Take one denomination of card from the deck for each player. Eg. If there are 5 players, take the Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, and 10's from the deck. If there are 12 players, use the whole deck. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Get a spoon for every player except one. Eg. if there are 6 players, get 5 spoons. Place the spoons on the table. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Deal out all of the cards. Everyone picks up their cards, and then the dealer starts calling 'Pass!'. When s/he says pass, each player must take one card from their hand and pass it to the left. The dealer can also say 'Pass right' or whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It works best if the dealer calls this every 3-4 seconds, so no one really has a chance to relax with their cards. This continues until someone gets four-of-a-kind, and then that player grabs a spoon and puts down their cards. All the other players then have to grab for a spoon, the loser being the one left out. If two players grab a spoon and neither lets go, the one holding the large end wins. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Loser must drink to pre-defined rules. Suggested rules are drinking for the number of seconds as the denomination of the winning 4-of-a-kind, or else polishing off their whole drink. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's an alternate source of information: newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoons	Every three-to-four seconds?

They are trying to make it harder to vote, and easier to own a gun.  Am I missing something, or is this backwards?	The first issue is stupid, but as an owner of a Concealed Carry in another state, this makes a lot of sense. Gun laws are pretty black and white: newlinechar  newlinechar Don't carry them to court, school, church, or anyplace that sells booze. newlinechar Do not shoot anything that does not threaten your life or the life of another. newlinechar Do not point your gun at anything you aren't willing to destroy. newlinechar  newlinechar The actual practice and safety of using a firearm is a totally different skill, more akin to long distance running: unless you practice it every day, you forget and get rusty.

Sorry, the problems that I describe are fundamentally agnostic to the content of the articles. Again, editorializing produces implications that are not supported by sources, because it introduces subjectivity. This is basic journalism.

K processors are not only overclockable but at a stock level faster than their non-K counterparts. If the price difference isn't too much between the K and the non-K (it's like $20) for that i5 you might as well get it.

The Economist's primary purpose is not to provide financial journalism but rather to bring a neo-liberal voice to the discussion of political economy. Yes, finance certainly is an increasingly large part of the economy, but the Economist has a much broader vision than the performance of assets. Something would be amiss if they *didn't* have a substantive story on Assad.	Exactly.  Their MO is that they provide the (usually) best positions for each side, and solidly take the stance that they consider the best, even while recognizing that there may not be a definitively best stance. The decision they make is also not necessarily the best in retrospect (e.g. on the Iraq war, which the openly admit they chose wrongly by taking the position of being for war), but the decision that, given the evidence at hand, appears to be the best. newlinechar

When dartcraft tools can be made easier than TiC ones and offer similar functionalities (lumberjack, area mining) most people will use Dartcraft over TiC. As a big fan of TiC, I really wish it would offer something that Dartcraft does not have, so more people would reconsider their metagame :P

I'm just sick of hearing it.  It's been beaten to death, brought back to life and then beaten to death again. Plus it is an inaccurate descriptor solely created for the purpose of being a catchphrase. I fucking hate catchphrases, especially played out ones and Pipebomb definitely falls in to that category.   newlinechar    newlinechar I feel like I made a decent argument and I'm pretty positive that any heat that's coming my way will be more based on 'He said something bad about CM Punk. Get him!' than anything else. It happened when I said something about The Shield so you'd think I would have learned my lesson. Unfortunately, I'm a natural dissenter. It's in my genes.	It's quite easy to dismiss people who disagree with you ahead of time by making up excuses for why they disagree with you before it's even happened. newlinechar  newlinechar I doubt anyone who thinks this is a silly thing to be upset about cares one way or the other about CM Punk.

That doesn't mean he has the sole authority to take us to war against another nation.  That authority lies Only with Congress.  Read the federal mandate, Article 1 Section 8.  An attack on a nations military is an act of war that cannot be taken by the President.  Maybe read a bit about what Jefferson has to say on the matter from our intervention in Tripoli. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Jefferson sent a small force to the area to protect American ships and citizens against potential aggression, but insisted that he was **'unauthorized by the Constitution**, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Although Congress never voted on a formal declaration of war, they did authorize the President to instruct the commanders of armed American vessels to seize all vessels and goods of the Pasha of Tripoli newlinechar  newlinechar Also Article 1, Section 8.

:) I guess that is ambitious.  I was just hoping to introduce them to coding, not actually teach them a whole ton.  Maybe just spark an interest that will lead them to pursue it on their own.   newlinechar  newlinechar In terms of a project, I was thinking about just having them create a simple game.  Guessing numbers or something.  I know it would have to be very basic. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, these kids are about 12 and will only do this project by choice, so they should already have some interest in it.	A 'Guess The Number' game would indeed be possible for them to make in that time frame. By 'fun' I thought you meant something graphical with animations and stuff. ;) newlinechar  newlinechar Here's an example of a simple 'Guess The Number' game: http://inventwithpython.com/chapter4.html newlinechar  newlinechar and even this example isn't perfect (it's got room for improvement - some are more obvious than others). Good thing about it though: if you chose to pick a different language for whatever reason, you could still use this as pseudo code.  newlinechar  newlinechar Hangman is also an idea for those ambitious ones wanting to impress their teacher. ;) The major differences here would be to keep track of score, used letters, correct letters and checking whether or not a letter is used in the word that is found in a word list (either 'hard coded' into the program code itself, or by loading the information from a text file - another topic to cover, if you so desire) as well as optional UI and ASCII art in the terminal. Hangman is definitely harder to do than guessing numbers, but nonetheless it shouldn't be completely impossible for an ambitious student.

I feel like we need to find a good cb who can win balls in the air, because I'm really tired of seeing other teams score on us on corners and free kicks from funny angles. That being said I think we should try to get someone like Clarence Goodson or Omar Gonzalez. They're both national team regulars for the U.S. and they're both good in the air with good height (I think they're both around 6'4' or so). And they both currently play in MLS which means we could probably get them pretty cheap. 	Goodson is absolutely not good enough and never will be. Omar Gonzales is not ready for this level of competition.

Tatar, too!	I worry about Tatar. He's a great player, and a good leader, but I think he might be full of himself. When he requested a trade because he didn't want to go through the Red wing's long developmental system, he put himself before the team. I could see him being traded this season for a top D-man, or him demanding too much money for future contracts and us letting him walk.

I prefer a mini with the cases and space I am looking at.

Leaning toward the latter.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't need to go for four slots of RAM.	8 is fast becoming a mandatory amount of RAM for serious games. newlinechar  newlinechar Having 16 is future proof.

&gt;One system of bra size labeling (I think European?) has a 'built-in' plus four.  newlinechar &gt; newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Thank you! That is exactly what I was asking here: newlinechar &gt;&gt;I guess what I'm asking is why is there not vanity sizing? newlinechar  newlinechar So I guess the answer is that they do! So just to make sure I understand the system, a girl that measures 70cm will buy a bra that says 70cm, but the bra will actually be 70cm + 4 inches (because I can't math.)? newlinechar  newlinechar So my question is, how does this affect correct sizing? With the built in plus four, does it still hold the same amount of volume as the equivalent 'correct' bra size? Like if I went to enter one of these 70cm bands into bratabase, would I enter it as 28 inches (the size it claims to be) or 32 inches (the real  size)? Does the 'built in +4' come from stretch in the bra, or does it measure 32  inches unstretched, and then actually stretches some more? 	Glad I could help! :)

Do you mind if I ask, why vice? 	No worries! Vice intrigues me because many police departments focus on sex trafficking, which is the part that interests me.

I'm a guy so I don't have that much knowledge when it comes to bras, but from what I've seen the crease goes right at the curve of the breast and that fabric is usually quite hard and abrasive. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean it's not uncommon to get indents in the skin from long term wear. newlinechar  newlinechar A sports bra will cover more, but it won't put heavy pressure directly on the tattoo. Also they're made of much more breathable material as I understand it.
Is there a way to move the game from my library into the inventory?	No. Once you have installed it that is it. Thank you anyway though.

Saying that you nearly failed high school because you just 'forgot' about all the assignments, does not bode well for you. If you are aware of this problem, why not, uh, REMIND YOURSELF about them? When you get an assignment, write it down in a calendar or something... this is not a hard problem to solve, and the fact that you just lived with it and never took ANY steps to correct the problem, probably indicates you will do terribly in college.	Please point out where I said I nearly failed high school. I encourage you

True, but they lost their 2012 QB and leading receiver from last year. They have a pretty good back in Antonio Andrews but a young defensive line that our offensive line should dominate.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't wanna discount Western Kentucky in any way, and Petrino is a proven asset, but I think this is more Kentucky being Kentucy than it is anything else. Also keep in mind this is Mark Stoops' first year as a head coach ever so that's another unknown in that game.	All are great points.

If you really want us to have a good season, then give us that bearded Spanish fella. Please :(.	Woah, Mata to Bradford would be insane. 
I wouldn't have him in my top 5. Shaq had some major durability issues and seemingly feuded with teammates and coaches wherever he went. Plus, he doesn't have the greatest track record of loyalty. I mean, his peak is definitely GOAT level but we have to look at their entire careers. I'm taking Jordan/LBJ/Kareem/Russ/Duncan/Hakeem over him to start a franchise. That's just me.	I think the point of this post was you're drafting players based on what we knew about them coming into their respective draft. We wouldn't know about Shaq's durability or teammate feuds when drafting him.

Maybe you're right. I've been in that situation as well where I've slept with someone but didn't want to be in a relationship with them. In my case, though, it wasn't because I didn't want to be in a relationship at that time. It was just because I didn't want to be with that person for various reasons (like having to hang out with his obnoxious friends who were embarrassing in public). It does definitely depend on the individual and the situation.	Can't argue with that. I know I've had periods where I wasn't interested in a relationship, or where I couldn't handle it, so I imagine other people do as well. That said, I always feel cynical about the line, 'It's not you, it's me.' I tend to think it's kinda always you. But maybe I'm wrong on that.

Didn't he also electrocute a live elephant (to death) to prove a point? Fucking asshole. 	Yeah he was angry at Tesla for his invention of the AC generator, which is what we use now. Edison wanted to push DC for power distribution which is almost unusable and required repeater stations every 50 feet from the power station to make up for the power loss. Tesla's AC power could be easily transported over long distances with only a little loss. Edison decided to try to prove to the public that AC was too dangerous for use by killing animals with it. This escalated to Edison convincing jails to use AC for their executions. He also paid off the officers to not use any electrolyte to help transfer the power into the person, to increase the horror of the electrocution. Even with all that Edison did to try to destroy AC it was eventually shown to be the best. Teslas generators were so good and efficient that the first major hydroelectric power plants ever installed in 1895 at Niagara falls was still in use until 1961 but could have worked well into the modern times. It was replaces by upgraded designs which were still based upon Tesla's work and designs. newlinechar  newlinechar TL:DR Edison killed animals and paid to increase unnecessary suffering of people being executed all to try and fail at destroying AC power. Edison evil, Tesla was awesome.

What does malnutrition have to do with an 80 year old women? 80 year old women suffer from malnutrition? Why 80 and not 81? she is healthier than an 81 year old women but not a 79 year old?	I believe there is a term called 'health markers'.  Things such as triglyceride levels, blood pressure, heart rate, bone mineral density, all sorts of things.  These things vary from person to person but there are typically 'averages' per age group.  I believe the article is going off the inference that the 'average' for health markers of people in their 80s are objectively worse than the 'average' for people in their teens.

Well. Punt returner. I'd like to think Benjamin is a top 5 punt returner, and he only returns kicks in certain situations. He's extremely fast, but he's small, so we don't want him returning EVERY kick risking injury.	He could turn into a great returner. But right now, from what has happened thus far, the dolphins returner thigpen is the better returner.

I mean; just look at TV's!  Look at how many times consumers have just stopped buying TV's, and that's why TV producers know they can't raise prices by 300%. . . so that explains why producers always walk that line of as high a price they can charge without causing people to stop buying TV's. . . oh, wait.  No, consumers don't do that, and producers don't do that either. newlinechar  newlinechar hmmm. . . I guess it has more to do with open competion. . . where, like, TV's keep getting cheaper and cheaper and yet better and bigger because the next competitor will wipe them out if they don't lower their prices. newlinechar  newlinechar But like, that totally doesn't happen with health care, because just look at the U.S. 'sick-care' system today!  It's totally and completely a reflection of nothing but deregulation and the complete whims of greedy capitalists, and if government would just like do something; then health-care wouldn't be the wild west where they exploit sick people because greed.  Except of course for the state-sanctioned AMA limiting of medical schools and doctors.  And of course the certificates of need that hospitals must acquire to open, and of course the one-size-fits-all regulations on medical practice, nor the dire need for tort reform, and of course the regulation and cartelization of medical insurers, price controls, medicare and medicaid, plus a million other things I can't list in my rant, plus the provisions of Obamacare which have gone into effect, and those about to go into effect which were purpose built to make sure that medical insurance and treatment get so expensive, that people will be begging for single-payer; which might possibly be better than the fascist debauchery of a medical system that we have now, but still worlds crappier than what we could have if markets were allowed to be free, like they are (or better yet, more than they currently are) in TV's and Food, and many other things that we need just as much as healthcare. newlinechar  newlinechar But besides all that, man, Starlos' argument totally sounds legit.

Ok I'll read up on rev matching and try to do it, it does sound hard to get right though..	It's really not. newlinechar  newlinechar I overthought it hardcore when I first heard of it. It's really not that complicated. I'm just bullshitting up numbers right now for the sake of discussion, they're not realistic at all but they explain the concept I hope. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, the RPM's of 45mph in 2nd gear is not the same RPM's of 45mph in 3rd gear. In fact they are quite a few thousand RPM's higher in the lower gear.  newlinechar  newlinechar So imagine you are at like 5000RPM's in 3rd gear going 45 mph. You downshift to 2nd. Your RPM's are now at like 9000. Suddenly shifting from 5000RPM's to 9000RPM's but at the same speed is going to throw your entire body forward and I assure you it is very, very, very scary. However, when the clutch is pulled in and you are downshifting you blip the throttle it will rise to like 9-11k RPM's and when you release the clutch you'll be at around the right RPM's for 2nd gear. newlinechar  newlinechar It's better to be over the RPM's of the gear you are shifting to than below them. You're above the RPM's of the gear you're shifting to every time you upshift and you barely feel it. It should all be one fluid motion. Clutch in, blip and downshift at same time, release clutch. Smooth as butter.

I think Dyrus' Karthus is even scarier - I think his fits better in the current meta.  Better to have regi on that ahri/zed type assassin and Dyrus on global artillery/teamfight zoning.

Regi needs to keep playing Zed and Ahri, because he likes to dive the back line, and that's just not as effective on Karthus.

Yes gotcha but then you also have two defenders with high attack rates if I'm not mistaking. 	You are correct but they don't seem to venture much further than the edge of the center circle which basically makes them two more defensive midfielders shutting down the opponents attacks. It ends up being a wall of three (Vertonghen, Fellaini and Luiz) and if the opponent manages to break away with one player he ends up one on one with Bochetti who is usually well positioned to hold up the play and allow the others to recover :) newlinechar

I had to tell him I didn't love him anymore to get him to accept it, which wasn't true, I still did. Years later I'm confident I made the right decision, but I haven't dated anyone since. It hurts because when I was breaking up with him he said to me, 'If you leave me you're just going to be alone, no one else will ever want to be with you' and it looks like he was right. Anyway. Thanks for letting me vent, internet stranger.
I'm 100% sure that replay ref needs lasik.	For them to overturn the call, they need to actually see the foot over the line.

Firstly, you don't need to quote in a patronising manner. newlinechar  newlinechar Onto the subject at hand, the problems you mention, such as best players retiring, are the exact kind of problems that SAF has minimised while other clubs suffer.

If you fail to recognise this, as Ive put it in another more obvious manner for three times now, you ought to drop this, I cant simplify it more, perhaps re-read the top comment. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, its this exact change thats the problem. United under SAF were able to change their strategy more easily, i,e out of a hyper-fluid 4-2-4 to a more rigid 4-4-1-1 as the players were more well versed in multiple positions and styles. Its this that allows for a change in system to happen with less adjusting time.  newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, what I'm saying isnt a some left of field view with no basis, I'm lost as to whether or not you understand the central, obvious, repeated hypothesis that the article, the top comment and I are all alluding to: SAF promoted a highly adaptable approach to tactics which created success for United for 20 years, phenomenal considering the EPL.	I'm not sure how I'm patronising by quoting you? It just makes it clearer as to which part I'm responding to. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Onto the subject at hand, the problems you mention, such as best players retiring, are the exact kind of problems that SAF has minimised while other clubs suffer. Looking at us, we transitioned out of the midfield of a decade ago, RVN, Ronaldo etc etc where other clubs have been troubled due to the reliance on one system. If you fail to recognise this, as Ive put it in another more obvious manner for three times now, you ought to drop this, I cant simplify it more, perhaps re-read the top comment. newlinechar  newlinechar Firstly, that's only 1 of the 4 reasons I mentioned (and indeed the most debatable one). And yes, I still fail to recognise how so this point is so inherently related to 'reliance on one system'. Our newer players that replaced the ones retiring/being sold were apparently still good to play in a different system. I'm pretty sure that whatever system you make the current Ajax players play in, or whatever way you train them, they're not going to do well outside of their league because they simply aren't that talented. It could well be that SAF was better at spotting talented players, finding players who would be useful on the level of United, than those clubs were.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Also, its this exact change thats the problem. United under SAF were able to change their strategy more easily, i,e out of a hyper-fluid 4-2-4 to a more rigid 4-4-1-1 as the players were more well versed in multiple positions and styles. Its this that allows for a change in system to happen with less adjusting time.  newlinechar  newlinechar But clearly they're showing that it's not even needed to have this possibility to change their strategy easily.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Frankly, what I'm saying isnt a some left of field view with no basis, I'm lost as to whether or not you understand the central, obvious, repeated hypothesis that the article, the top comment and I are all alluding to: SAF promoted a highly adaptable approach to tactics which created success for United for 20 years, phenomenal considering the EPL. newlinechar  newlinechar And what I'm saying is that I don't see the benefit of this as opposed to how other top European clubs handle themselves. This is all I said. You came up with Ajax and Milan which I find faulty counter-examples because I believe the 4 reasons I listed are more of a reason of their (supposed) demise. And yes, 1 of those 4 reasons might be connected though like I said I don't think it is. And even then Milan won a CL only the season before we did most recently..

Let me splain... No no, it's too much. Let me sum up. 17-18years old and I'd finally got the girl of my dreams who had friend zoned me for years. I was the rebound guy and as such didn't last as BF. but I had befriended her and her family for some time and was trying to remain close though it was crushing me. I had been talking to her mother about all the drama and she was very sympathetic. I swung by one evening and my ex was getting ready for a night out with her new Bo who happened to be her ex Bo prior to me. I tried to play it cool. Her mom could tell I was upset and offered me some wine. Ex leaves, I stay chatting up her mom on the couch. She's late 40 early 50. It's funny how the tell tale signs when a girl/woman wants you, are relatively the same at any age except for one thing. If you don't make the obvious move on an older woman, she will. She did. It was awkward. For me at least. Don't get me wrong, it was hot, but I was used to younger girls and she wasn't exactly young. Very attractive and aggressive but I don't think my youth could keep up with her needs. I gave it my all and that was that. I don't think ex ever found out to my knowledge. I'd been back a couple times since and always wondered if that look in her moms eye was a 'yeah we fucked' or if it was 'I bet you're much better now'. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: added some clarity and grammar.

Putting our best striker further away from the Box is a terrible idea imo, Balotelli is not a trequrista, he has some good passes but a lot of the time they're great because he's the one pulling defenders away creating space, with defenders covering the strikers he could end up giving the ball away A LOT. Also putting our biggest goal threat further away from the net will only give the opponents incentive to play with a higher back line. newlinechar  newlinechar Stephans goal scoring has nothing to do with confidence imo, and everything to do with learning a new position (LW, playing with another striker) plus no longer being the focal point of every final pass. He's only 20, strikers don't hit their prime till like 25-27. Also his goals only kept us afloat, we were 13th place, with Balotelli we shot back up and went on a no lose streak, Stephan was great but we needed a whole striker that put fear into teams. newlinechar  newlinechar Also fuck Kaka, 5m a year plus a signing fee will destroy our already fragile finances, especially for an injury prone player. We need TWO trequristas to replace Boateng. Not half of one. newlinechar  newlinechar No one knows how Galliani moves, he brought in De Jong when we needed a defensive mid, maybe he'll bring in two trequrista's, but I doubt it since we blew our wad on Balotelli in the winter. With our current formation I'd MAYBE play 433, but we have no right winger that can cross AND score, so I'd rather see 442. newlinechar  newlinechar Abate - Zapata - Mexes - De Sciglio newlinechar  newlinechar Poli - Montolivo - De Jong - Robinho newlinechar  newlinechar Balotelli - Stephan newlinechar  newlinechar It plays to our strengths, doesn't put anyone out of positions, and gives us a lot of defensive cover.

Because it was a call that should've gone in favor of NY. Not to sound like a cry baby but for whatever reason this is the reality of our club more often than not. 	That sounds a bit like a cop-out saying that only happens to New York... and maybe a selection bias. It happens to all clubs.

&gt;  newlinechar &gt; -those brands you mentioned just produce a wider range of sizes they don't make their bras differently than other companies  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe I can better explain by extrapolating my thought process.  newlinechar  newlinechar 1. It seems to be widely believed that early bras were made out of fabric that was did not stretch as much as modern fabrics do. So in order to get a bra that you could actually breathe and move around in, you had to add to add 4 inches to your bust measurement and buy that band size.  newlinechar  newlinechar 2. This means that +4 would have been the standard measurement method.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3.  Now, women are in incorrectly fitting bras because this fitting method has stuck around, while the fabric used to make those bras have not.  newlinechar  newlinechar 4. So, back when the standard method was to add +4, and adding +4 DID provide the correct fit, then at what point did other bra companies stop using this method?  newlinechar  newlinechar 4b. Did those bras even actually fit those ladies? Was sister sizing a thing back then? Let's say a lady from those times measures as a 28D. Adding +4 would make a 32 inch band, so would she have sister sized into a 32B? Or would she just wear a 32D?  newlinechar  newlinechar 5. If +4 was necessary to get a good fit around the underbust, but the cups were fitting them, how did that affect cup size now? So like if in my example, the woman would wear a 32D, and the cups fit fine when she actually measures a 28D with the ABTF measurements, doesn't that mean that the volume would be off according to today's standards?  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;and even some of the upscale brands with a large ranges of sizes like Ewa Michalak measure differently than we do here and use +4 newlinechar  newlinechar Ok, so maybe what I'm getting at is that if the manufacturers advocate measuring incorrectly for their product, then why do we get a correctly fitting product using ABTF guidelines? If most common brands require you to take an incorrect measurement, then it seems like their product would be tailored to fit the incorrect measurements, so why is this not the case? 	I understand the bra size history but that again has nothing to do with modern brands (except for maybe wonder bra?) so I would still say that is irrelevant.  newlinechar  newlinechar I am sure someone else will explain the 'what you're getting at' point better than I can (it's 2am here and I am ready for bed!) 
Could Holly still be in the house when Jessie drops the match? Wouldn't put it past Vince to kill a baby. 	It's definitely possible, and I wouldn't put it last him either. But Im not 100% sure the house is gonna burn, at least this episode. Some previews have shown Walt and Skyler in the house, and it looks pretty undamaged.
That's a little extreme.	Yeah, I'm more inclined to think people like him should just be informed that they say stupid things, maybe one day the desire for approval will encourage him to act less stupid.

I used it on candles, for future security. I found a Djinn, and I want to wish for a magic marker, how many charges should I wish for? I don't know how wishing for charges works.	It's been a long time since I've seen a spoiler for wishing for charges with regards to the magic marker, but I think you just wish for an uncursed one (so whatever your write just uses the BUC of the blank scroll) and hope for a good amount of charges. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, in the mid to late game, I usually think that a magic lamp is worth more than one wish.

I don't understand.  Are you arguing in favor of staying in an abusive relationship because of fears of fines and incarceration?  I agree with you that the divorce/alimony system is broken and needs fixed, but I'd also argue that those concerns are not a reason to stay.  So, yes, even if there's the risk of multiple jail sentences, you should leave if you're being crushed by your spouse.  	I don't know, just some thoughts I had. I guess I wanted to say that this decision should not be a quickly made decision and that getting out is probably for the better.

Not really. I watch my dad basically monoskiing most of the time. I do it too every once in a while. You just need to have good control and forsight. Don't try this if you leave the prepared slope next to a black slope though since deep snow or irregular snow screw you up too hard.	Well, I mean it's different if you monoski of course, that's a whole new technique.

Especially when it comes to jobs that 'require' earning tips. Take for instance the restaurant industry (lots of unmarried people); the men slave away over hot stoves, work long hours with few breaks, and are at risk for serious injury, alcoholism, and drug use (because the job is just straight up fucking stressful and dangerous at times). Most make a wage slightly above that of McDonald's worker. newlinechar  newlinechar Waitresses on the other hand, are only required to carry the food to the table and be sexually attractive. So long as you're young, and attractive you can make ass-tons of cash. It wasn't unusual to see the hot waitresses bring home $200+ a night. They could make more than us on tips alone but, they also get an hourly wage (usually $7-$9/hr). If it's a low-pay restaurant the women will make almost twice as much as back of house (and holy shit do they complain if they are told to tip us out).  newlinechar  newlinechar The icing on the cake is after work, these same waitresses would get guys to buy them drinks. newlinechar  newlinechar There should be a rule: 'Never buy a drink for any woman that she works for tips. If she's attractive, she probably brings home more than $1,500 bi-weekly.'	Never buy a drink for a woman.

This is a cycle prepared by a seller and sold as a 'beginners cycle with everything you need.' so theres a little bit of faith on my side. what doesn't make sense about it. Too much crap?	I have never seen deca cycle that short.  Deca should be run at least 15 weeks,  usually more.  Why switch to test p after 6 weeks? Test E doesn't even kick in for 4 weeks.  And such a small test p dose,  seems extremely strange.  That is like trt dose.  I can see what they wanted having it half bulk half cut but it is wrong wrong wrong.  Especially for a first cycle. I should also add that clen should not be ran 6 weeks straight.  This is wrong in every way.  Do research and if you want to run AAS do test E for 12+ weeks,  maybe do dbol or drol for the first 4. Simple and it works.

You can buy a ticket for a number between 00001 and 99999. Last year, there were 180 series for each ticket.   newlinechar  newlinechar Some numbers are more sought after than others, for example numbers that refer to dates that are important for you: 11-9-01, 31-8-74, 1-11-81; while some others are avoided based on the (wrong) perception that a number like 12345 or 88888 being winner would be 'too much of a coincidence'. The last two numbers are important too, because each ending has a different name and some people buy one or the other depending on their mood: 90 is 'the Grandpa', 16 is 'Virgin Mary', 15 is 'the pretty girl', 51 is 'the goat', 52 'the tomato', 99 is 'the agony' because 00 is 'the Death', etc. Some families have made a tradition out of buying the very same number (or ending) every single year for decades, in the hope that it will be the winner some day. By the way, the number 00000 is played too, but it's traditionally given as a present to the King of Spain (stupid, I know) so you can't actually buy any ticket for it.   newlinechar  newlinechar A ticket costs a lot, â¬200, so you'll usually buy a _dÃ©cimo_, a 'tenth' of a ticket which costs (you guessed it) â¬20. This _dÃ©cimos_ are commnly shared between friends, or given as a present to beloved ones before the draw. Many small businesses and mostly associations also use them to earn some extra cash, by selling shares of a given number with an added profit margin, say, â¬2,50 for a 2â¬ share + â¬0,50 profit for the business (this is regulated by law)... newlinechar  newlinechar (EDIT: As /u/milesgmsu noted, I forgot to mention that numbers are distributed by regions, so each lottery seller sells only 1 or 2, maybe 5 different numbers at most. This favors scenarios like the one in the article where a lot of people from the same town or neighborhood win the lottery at the same time, because they all bought the same number in the same place, so the hapiness is shared throughout the community :) In fact, many people exchange tickets with their relatives in other cities or provinces 'just in case', or search the internet to learn where their preferred number is sold and make a trip to buy it. /EDIT) newlinechar  newlinechar ANYWAY. The day of the drawing, they fill this BIG bingo ball with exactly 100,000 marbles, each with a different number engraved; and then they fill another, smaller, bingo ball with 1,807 more marbles, each engraved with a prize, and only 1 of them being 'el Gordo', the â¬4,000,000 prize. They shake both balls a little, and then the drawing starts: couples of kids from the San Ildefonso Orphanage take one marble from the big ball (the number) and one marble from the small ball (the prize), 'chant' the number and prize to the public and jury, and put them aside in a table of prized marbles. Rinse and repeat until you run out of prize marbles. newlinechar  newlinechar Source: I'm Spanish. But if you want to know more, here's the Wikipedia page on [Spanish Christmas Lottery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Christmas_Lottery). And here's a video from the moment they drawed 'el Gordo' in 2010: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qz9pphQHZc (actual chanting at 0:50 but it's cute to see how nervous the left kid was).	that's so cool

Adam *has* no ancestors. God created Adam by taking various muds and clays from the Earth, and molding them into the shape of Adam's body.

There have been different subspecies of humans, Neanderthals being the best known example, but recently we've found out about the Denisovans too. A couple examples of relatively recent human evolution that I know of are lactose tolerance into adulthood and the lesser prevalence of wisdom teeth as compared to the past.	How do pre-human primates fit into this vision of God making Adam and Eve from scratch? Did God just say 'these things are similar enough to me and what I want to create in the likeness of me, let me create from scratch things that look like them and use the same mechanics and genetics as them.'

Since when was impatience the hallmark of a mature male? She's already begged him not to dump her on several occasions. I'd say that's a good place to start therapy from. If she was brazenly telling him to leave, then that would be different.	Since when did the powers that be give you the right to define others as a man? newlinechar  newlinechar Being so harshly judged for breaking traditional gender role fulfillment is what is holding our gender back.  You would not call a woman in his position 'not a real woman', nor would you tell her to woman up.  On the contrary, how many lost their shit when Hillary Clinton did what you are asking this man to do? newlinechar  newlinechar You do not define him as a man; neither do I, nor anyone else.  And we can have our opinions and judgements, sure, but we, too, will be judged for our judgement.

Didn't the original tournament rules posted state: newlinechar &gt;All participants can switch around their decks but are locked to the class they've chosen before the Tournament starts. newlinechar  newlinechar So it sounds like if Trump and Kugen had a PERSONAL gentlemen's agreement to not change their deck between games (despite the rules saying they could) and then later breaking that agreement (supposedly Kungen did?) then that explains the ensuing fallout. How can people say 'Awww poor Trump and Kungen I feel so bad for these poor innocent guys' when they directly caused it because of their own decisions? newlinechar 	No, both viewerships suddenly started calling the other player streamsniping, despite both of them NOT doing something like that.   newlinechar Even worse, they began to tell their streamers the opponents deck and both are avid chatreaders normally... they both had no idea how to handle the situation at first :/   newlinechar At that point they both already knew 2-3 of the opponent's decks thanks to those idiots in chat...   newlinechar I also felt so sorry for them, they just wanted to have fun at that tournament and those idiots just ruined it

That's not really what OP is looking for. Sure, focusing on escapes and defense at white/blue belt is great, but nobody is going to want to keep doing BJJ if they don't do submissions until they get to black belt.	He'll obviously still pick up submissions along the way. Nothing wrong with focusing solely on defense and escape for all of white and most of blue though. Lays a much more solid foundation, and by really understanding the defense and escapes, you get a much better grasp of how to nullify defense during your offense as well as the positional control essentials to prevent escapes.
I kind of figured this was the case, but I was uncertain since enchanted illusions seemed to have Radiance disabled. Also, somebody pointed out in a deleted comment that the fatal source of damage was from my illusion, but it was attributed to brown for some reason. newlinechar  newlinechar I will look at the forums when I get the chance.	Enchanted illusions should still do radiance burn, and the real PL did receive burn damage from the enchanted illusion in that game (you can even see in the screenshot the dire creepwave taking radiance damage). newlinechar  newlinechar It is still an illusion of brown's, and it was brown's actual radiance that killed puck.  But the enchanted illusion got kill credit, and it was on your team so it became a deny. newlinechar  newlinechar There might have been multiple bugs at play here, but at least one was that puck's radiance source was still attributed to the illusion on their team.

I've discussed this exactly. Seth McFarlane's defenders used 'satire' as an excuse when he did the 'I saw your boobs' song too, and if it is satire, okay, fine, but the majority of his audience isn't in on the joke, and he is certainly still cashing their checks.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think this sort of laziness just happens in TV after awhile. Same thing with the Simpsons. It went from being satirical pop culture stuff, to just topical. More observational humor than societal satire. It's a shame. 	I'd like to talk to Seth McFarlane 'off the record' sometime. I wonder if the change to the show was fully voluntary, as in, he simply chose to appeal to the newer audience more, or if he truly believes his satire, but doesn't care it's lost on the audience.

&gt;You'll see that the most aesthetically-elegant products employing the Metro design language focus more on consistency (particularly in colors), typography, and iconography, instead of the 'blotchy colored boxes everywhere' approach of Xbox (360 and One) and Windows 8. newlinechar I really do prefer the start screen over newlinechar  newlinechar I have a Windows Phone, Windows 8, and a 360... I don't really understand what you're saying with 'blotchy colored boxes everywhere' newlinechar  newlinechar They all *do* look pretty uniform in design and function to me.	One of the most attractive things (to me) about WP is that the majority of the tiles are the same color.  You have a few 'full-bleed' tiles (e.g. photos) and a few Metro-style tiles with their own color (Skype, Music), but most of them are your chosen accent color, which permeates the experience of using the OS.  It gives it a sense of cohesion. newlinechar  newlinechar In Windows 8, however, there's this mixture of Metro tiles, where the developer can choose whichever color they want, and Desktop tiles, where the color is matched to one of {red, orange, green, blue, purple, grey}.  It completely sacrifices the cohesive feeling for the sake of app differentiation, and I think the result's ugly. newlinechar  newlinechar My gripe with the Xbox dashboard is that one of Metro's primary tenants is surfacing the user's content, and hiding everything else.  Instead of showing tiles of the user's game and music library at least 70% of most dashboard screens is dedicated to 'content discovery' tiles, which is a form of advertisement - pushing the user to buy more games and rent movies.  Once Xbox was a successful, popular product, Microsoft began tarnishing it.

I haven't been but I figured as much.  The question was about if I owned a range, and honestly, I feel like the margins on this type of range would be far above a traditional range since it's more of a hangout spot.

The Dallas location is the highest grossing bar in the city and you get all kinds of people out there.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's a blast when I have time to get out there, but I'll stick to the traditional ranges for practice :)
Okay, full disclosure: I don't fully understand how stocks work. newlinechar  newlinechar How does that put Enron in debt? It is because their stocks were worth way more than the company was, and the debt was the difference between their perceived value and their real value, so if there ever came a time when more people were selling than buying, Enron wouldn't be able to pay back investors for their stock? newlinechar  newlinechar Is that how Enron was betting their entire future on the hopes that their stock would never significantly fall, and then committing a ton of accounting fraud to ensure that?	First, lets define Stock. newlinechar  newlinechar Think of Stock as a unit of ownership.  If there is a company and they sell 1,000 stocks that means each stock is worth 1/1000 of the company.  In theory, the total value of the company, divided by 1000, would be the value of each stock (and some eye to the future value of the company). newlinechar  newlinechar What happened was that the executives colluded to hide debts and failures, via shady accounting, sub-companies and some outright deceptive practices artificially pushed the value of the stock up higher than it really was. newlinechar  newlinechar So eventually an outside auditor stumbled across something suspicious.  Interestingly enough, and I don't know the exact circumstances but I do know they were involved in the scandal, one of the 'big five' accounting firms went down in the entire thing, I know they were convicted of obstruction of justice. 
the point is that, in ranked games you are allowed to ban every single champion. It's not like in normal's where you can only ban the champions that the other team own.	Since I mostly duoQ with a friend, I always get first pick so I know this as a fact, you can't ban champions that no one has (and I know it because there are always some champions missing)

&gt;The dev is doing this alone and made it pretty clear this was only a hobby, not full time. newlinechar  newlinechar The dev made it clear this was a hobby?

True, but the game gives you so many options to kill people that it's easy to grow bored of playing it just stealthily. I think that COD comparison for people who choose to play it that way is a bit unfair.	It gives you just as many options to not kill people. There was a bone charm that let you strangle people super fast, you could become a fish and swim in, Many of the roofs had no guards but were tricky to get up onto, the time freeze was its most useful when going stealth and you were noticed.  newlinechar  newlinechar You're right the COD reference was unfair because the interface in Dishonoured was way better. But it was set up in a way that made stealth play just as good as combat play.

That is strange and as an expert because I watched a couple of episodes of hoarders.............they always seem to be able to identify random items quite easily.	Haha, well I don't know if that's staged or not.

My point is that you can't (or shouldn't) be bound to something (ie- forced to give up some of your capital) - if you personally weren't involved in the decision process.	Why not? newlinechar  newlinechar And what about if you were involved in the process but strongly disagree with the ultimate decision?  Should you be forced to follow an agreement that you oppose, that seems just as bad or worse. newlinechar  newlinechar Should a child say 'I wasn't involved in the decision of when my bed time was, and therefore I don't have to follow it' newlinechar  newlinechar I'll admit that most people won't take this argument seriously (Although I'm not sure I've seen many arguments that logically justify society's treatment of the young without implying all sorts of other ridiculous things, we're not talking about age discrimination here though). newlinechar  newlinechar Going back to that, when we remove nearly all rights from anyone under the age of 18, their parents get to make decisions on their behalf.  I would argue that those parents by choosing to remain here have an implicit agreement to follow the laws of the land.  Upon reaching the age of majority you can make your own decisions whether you want to stay here or not, it may not be easy to leave (or well, to enter somewhere else, leaving is usually pretty easy) but that's up to the decisions your parents made. newlinechar  newlinechar You can also chain this back generations, your grandparents made the decision on behalf of your parents, and your great-grandparents for your grandparents.  This chain can easily lead you back to either whenever your ancestors came here (and in coming here pretty explicitly agreed to follow the laws that were around previously even if they didn't have a say in writing them) or back to the time the laws were written in which your ancestors had as much say in the process as we do today (realistically next to nothing, but in the ideas of representative democracy, some). newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying we can't advocate changing the rules, there's lots of laws I'd like to see change including some major constitutional changes (screw you 'notwithstanding clause').  And that brings us back to the point of this story.  When we decide to change the constitution how do we decide to go about doing it?  Thing is, we already have a perfectly good way of doing it all lined out already.  Sure we could try it a different way, but we'd need to get everybody to agree to use the different way, so instead why not use the way implicitly agreed upon by your choice (or your parent's choice while you were a minor) to remain or become a citizen?

Unfortunately, finding membership/attendance data for non-denoms is hard since there is no central agency to provide statistics for their congregation(s)..

I agree. This is not a combat vessel or a top-of-the-line multipurpose ship like the Constellation. This is exactly a cockpit consistent with its role as a workhorse not a warship. newlinechar  newlinechar If the view isn't 'good enough' then upgrade to the Constellation - which has an open view in a nod to its multipurpose role as a freighter and a Space Superiority vessel. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I love the low-tech analog look of the Freelancer. It's daring, unique, and immersive in a game as beautiful in SC and in a genre that frankly over uses generic minimalist cockpits purely for the sake of gameplay purists who would gladly make ships interchangeable save for specs. newlinechar  newlinechar But that's just my opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar (Disclosure: I own both a Freelancer and Constellation. I am a Flight Sim fan.)	No, it isn't. The cockpit has a very work-horse type feel to it, but that doesn't come from the pylons. It comes from the side-by side seating and general layout. No vehicle manufacturer in their right mind would sell a vehicle with a structural pylon that sits right in front of the driver's face, and no trader/explorer with half a brain would be willing to buy one, especially if that person knew the space they were traveling through could potentially be more hazardous than the I-5 back home. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: there's a way to make both sides of the coin happy. Go look at the cockpit of a C-130, or a B-25, or even a UH-1 Huey, all 'noncombat' aircraft that look rugged and have struts without completely compromising the view.

I guess I could have a few ready, allowing me to use something better looking than paper/napkin. Would it be weird being evident I'd prepared in advance, though?	A napkin is your best bet, or you could just program it into her phone. Or, if y'all are being really cute and flirty like a 90s movie, on her arm. Although this does run the risk of her not being able to make it out later.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: DISCLAIMER: Obviously ask her first. 
That sounds awesome, how many cups does that roughly translate to? 	Not as much as it sounds. The coffee gets hulled and roasted loosing aprox 1/3 the weight.

As an air traffic controller I can safely say that you have two different jobs mixed. Air traffic controllers use radios from inside a building to tell pilots where to go. And maintenance personnel use those 'light-up signals' to help the pilot park in the correct location(this is called marshalling). And those maintenance personnel are only near the parking locations, never on the runway. But yes, it would be comical to see maintenance personnel marshalling aircraft in the buff. newlinechar 	Okay :) I totally forgot what they were called, so I just inserted something I thought was close. Thanks! And yes, very goofy.
Why can't they? They have to find a whole other brand of parking meter because one meter is under ceiling? Maybe they have more than one meter, and THOSE make use of the solar panels.

Glad I could offer some help :)  newlinechar  newlinechar And don't worry at all about your providers judging you or being annoyed by you having a hard time with injections. If they do, that's their problem, not yours. The only reason I could do the rebif for a while because of the auto-injector. My insurance providers wanted nothing to do with me getting on such an expensive drug as Gilenya, so they instead first approved me for copaxone, and requested that I try that for a while. For whatever reason, an auto-injector wasn't available to me for that drug, so my neurologist had me come in so she could show me how to self administer a subcutaneous injection.  newlinechar  newlinechar Funny story time: After spending three minutes trying to poke myself with her watching, shaking from nerves the whole time... she called it off. My face had gone gaunt white and she was concerned I was about to faint.  newlinechar  newlinechar After that, she relayed the results back to my insurance, who grudgingly authorized the Gilenya, since I couldn't perform self injections. It was a bit embarrassing at first, but we all had a good laugh about it, and in the end I finally got on the meds she wanted me on.  newlinechar  newlinechar Point is, professionals don't judge, and I hope you don't have to jump through all the hoops I did to get onto a new drug. Not sure how Scotland's health care system operates exactly, but I can't imagine it being much worse than America's.	Wow, I just couldn't do that! Injecting myself with the auto injector was hard enough I think I would have just flatly refused if I had to do it all manually! I am so glad that you did manage to get what you needed though, I think that I should be able to get something more suited for me as while the NHS is slow it is usually quite good if you are willing to wait.

If your parents are loaded and paying for everything, maybe a place like UND makes sense.  The expenses are ridiculous for what you get.  That said I'm not familiar with every school out there.  I've heard of some very reasonable colleges with a part 61 program, but they weren't too common. newlinechar  newlinechar Still it seems like most flight schools you're going to you'll be taught by a relatively low time CFI.  Sometimes you can find a good flight school that has some flight instructors that teach now that they're retired or are working a good pilot job and just take a handful of students on.  I wouldn't recommend getting all of your ratings from someone like that, but even a tailwheel endorsement from someone who's got a lot of time can be a good way to pick up on things your normal CFIs might not be aware of. newlinechar  newlinechar I would recommend looking for a flight school where you can take the plane on solo cross countries reasonably.  In college I'm sure you'll do a few road trips, but you need to build time anyway.  Why not take a few friends somewhere and have them split the cost of the hotel room?  That or fly home on breaks? You've got a great chance to see a lot of the country and many college and 141 programs are very uptight about where you can take the plane by yourself.  You can even save yourself some more money by finding other pilots like yourself to split time with, with one being the safety pilot. newlinechar  newlinechar Ultimately I think you'll be far better off saving your money and going to a local flight school or CFI that's unaffiliated or loosely affiliated with a nearby college/learning institution than going to a big school.  I know plenty of pilots from big flight schools who have a shit ton of student loan debt and very little to show for it.  If you're going the airline route, it'll likely be something hanging over your head for a very long time.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you're intent on spending that money I'm sure you could get several 100 hours more from a private flight school compared to what you'd graduate one of those big schools with.  newlinechar  newlinechar Getting the private can suck, but be persistent.  After that flying gets much, much better.	Also one more thing to look for is aero clubs.  There are some great ones scattered throughout the country.  There may be a small buy in, but do your research and with how much you'll be flying you'll likely come out well ahead with the discounted hours you fly plus the buy in than at many flight schools.  I've even heard of some aero blubs ran on military bases that were open to the public or maybe through some loophole where you had to join the Civil Air Patrol.  They looked very tempting to learn at. newlinechar  newlinechar All I can say is to stick with it.  There are some bad flight instructors and flight schools out there.  If you're feeling mistreated or under appreciated you may actually be. newlinechar  newlinechar Buying blocks of time can be a smart way to save money, but I'd be careful as there have been flight schools that would ask for the money for the rating upfront.  I've heard of several schools where the owner would then run off with the money and leaving people with a fraction of the rating they paid for.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are also a ton of cool jobs out there.  I thought I was dead set on going to the regionals, but the more I progress and the more jobs I work and come across the more I see myself never going that route.  Keep an open mind and have some fun along the way.  
guh, its nice to see tsm actually stepping up and playing like an actual team again. But i was really hoping to see vulcan take the cake for these games. I'm really not interested in seeing tsm getting beaten before 20 mins again by the korean teams. At least vulcan/C9 offer some hope of putting up a moderate fight.	Honestly though, if Vulcun loses this badly to TSM, I honestly don't see them having a chance against a Korean team. I think C9 has a chance against the koreans, but if Vulcun gets dismantled 2-0 to TSM, I don't think it's really fair to say they'd put up a fight.

And honestly, if you had THAT much money tied up in Gox, you could always just pay the 5% fee to have it removed.

&gt;I tried working out before for 4 months and saw no results newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah...I'm pretty sure he needs to start a novice strength program, doing things properly this time, build up muscle, and *then* cut. He needs a solid foundation for a beautiful house. Otherwise, he'll look way too skinny trying to get rid of that last bit of fat which won't go away. The increase in muscle will help better distribute that skin and fat combo.	Ya i agree that is the right way to do it for long term results.  But if he really just wants to lose the gut and thats all he cares about then diet will fix that.  
Yeah. I'm gonna be a freshman and all the girls look like little children. I can't date someone that looks 11 years old. Then the guys are either ALL MACHO AND TALLLLL or look like they're 8 and ^^really ^^really ^^tiny newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Spelling	Ah, freshman year. You can admire all of the upperclassman all you want, but because you're a freshman, you'll never get acknowledged. Feels good being a sophomore. Still not acknowledged, but it's a start. xD
You poke the shrimp with your finger.  It begins to vibrate violently, and hops off the tray onto your hand.  It begins to grow quickly to the size of the average gerbil.  One side of the shrimp begins to flap up an down, as if there is a mouth where the rice and shrimp meet.  newlinechar  newlinechar What do?_	*&gt;* SAY HELLO TO SHRIMP
No rush. Also, we got named drop in an mls thread Cisco was in. Woo.	We did? Hahahahaha. I kinda feel bad. He's getting swarmed with it.
You sir/lady are awesome. This community needs more people like you.	sir, and thank you. Half the fun is showing off all the neat stuff you can make.
Thanks for the AMAA! Small word of advice...from my perspective.... newlinechar  newlinechar It's already a super creepy and awkward topic.  My I suggest not adding the winky face to the actual 14 year old girls comment? newlinechar  newlinechar I say that in the utmost respect...	I think he just slipped into 14 y.o. girl mode for a second. It was a lapse.
[From @Gidget](http://i.imgur.com/wVniGwm.gif)	holy doodle that was scary then funny but damn.  a bat flying at you? nope.
that is correct.  once you vape the bud out; it already hits the optimal temperatures necessary for consumption.  Throw it into anything that you eat, and enjoy the ride.   newlinechar  newlinechar I've heard that fatty foots work best, I guess because the cannibanoids bind to the fatty proteins but I am not sure.  I followed an awesome walk through last week that involved melting chocolate and making my own peanut butter cups.  In the middle I had peanut butter, powdered sugar, and ten grams of AVB (total)... and it brought me to the moon and back newlinechar  newlinechar 	You have completely changed my life, thank you so much!
I would say tusk is mediocre. But he does have his strengths. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think he's worth trilane farm, which means you'd probably do either a support tusk, or a solo mid tusk, or a throwaway offlane tusk. newlinechar  newlinechar I could maybe see a support tusk. newlinechar His ult basically stuns through magic immunity for 1 second. His sigil can be used for scouting as well (even if it is only level 1). Ice shards scales only with damage and cooldown, so theres no loss for a support to only have 1 level of this, it has 100% cc with just the one level. newlinechar  newlinechar Could work mid though, similar to dragon knight with less push/tank. newlinechar  newlinechar I think ultimately wherever you put him, he will most likely won't pack as much of a punch as other heroes in the lane would. newlinechar  newlinechar I would say he's considerably stronger than a bunch of the other nonpicked heroes. He has fairly reliable CC, He has counter push, his CC level 1 isn't terrible. He is melee though,  it's easy to exploit grouping up the snowball causes. newlinechar  newlinechar I think he could use with a buff to snowball, especially the stun duration, or perhaps an intelligence increase. I think he has a bunch of potential though.  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as pubs go though, he's not too shabby. Not much a fan of the old battlefury build though. 	One think to note though is he matches up well vrs. some strong mids like qop because of snowball
[](/dashiepose2)How's your day been? Much happen? newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah...	[](/pretzelnom) Pretty boring. Just talked to /u/anuspony and set up for a family party. You?

That's possibly a million dollar idea app. imo, maybe not a million dollars, but a good chunk of cash if you were to charge for the app. 	Thanks! Fingers Crossed!
He's go getter Greg!	 You could come over tonight I'll be watching cop dramas Smoking fatty fatties
I should probably clear up that we have not been dating for three years. We met in college and had a flirtationship/friendship that ended in an awkward one night stand. He had the same issue in that encounter, IIRC. We stopped talking for about a year and then became friends again and have continued the flirtationship until we began dating about a month or so ago. Up to this point, we've only made out. No sex or oral. 	Yeah, I know you've only been dating a short time. I still think that he's been holding it in a lot longer than one month. 
And the waiter/waitress would come up to the table and say 'welcome, I lost the game. How can I help you this evening?'	I'm torn between wanting to downvote and upvote you at the same time. So I'll just say this and call it a day: I lost the game :(
My mother and most of her parish do not, and neither do any of the Catholic schools I grew up in, though many of the students didn't really care--they just didn't speak up about it.	Sooooo.. What HAPPENED?!
thanks :) I just feel terrible that so many people think my boyfriend is a rapist, he's such a wonderful person :c	reddit is not a good place when it comes to sane people.  Most people here are WAAAY off normal. newlinechar  newlinechar Hence the obsession with cats and ducks.
... Fate	God dammit, now I gotta kill him for the Twilight joke *and* fucking up my sleep schedule. newlinechar  newlinechar So what territory needs an ass-kicking?
well ive been playing on a low level laptop since launch, so definetly u dont need super expensive pc to play. newlinechar  newlinechar Ive gout an i7 q740   pqired with an nvidia 360m , and every uneeded effect shut off and textures at high i pulled 60-90 fps on warpgate and 30-40 on battles with absoulute lowest being in the 20fps range during game breaking patches.  couldnt play at all after gu14, now i can play again. Ive am an expert however an modufying the game ini and videocard settings to squeeze out all i can.  SDome off my friends dont have the patience to pull this off , and sadly tried the game and quit.  Some things should be default turned off like SHADOWS!! sony have the game boot up for first time players with medium settings do u dont turn people off.  Like 1920x1080 ,aaa and fancy effects.	I completely understand what you are saying but an i7 is no slouch by any stretch of the imagination and intel CPUs fair better than AMD ones i was just pointing out the misconception of the game needing to be 'optimized for AMD CPUs'. Also any small amount of research can give you nice settings for your INI but new players shouldn't have to do this. 20Fps for me personally is completely unplayable and the game needs optimizing some it really does. Thanks for your input man ! 
No, it still looks retarded. 	^^^Some ^^^people ^^^find ^^^it ^^^hot
Where are you located? I saw this the other day, and I've never tried it, but it may just be enough http://www.freedompop.com/ newlinechar AFAIK, it's US based only.	Anyone checking them out needs to read the reviews on Amazon.
You used an abbreviation period as the period to your sentence. 	So? newlinechar  newlinechar You completely omitted commas and didn't even use a full stop in your first reply, but it's irrelevant so I didn't mention it.

Tomato meatballs and Caviar. 	They also talked about steamed halibut with a berblanc sauce and salmon roe sprinkled on top. Yum.
What contact_lens_linux said is correct, but you ABSOLUTELY NEVER go left when using this technique. ALWAYS right. If you're going to get hit from behind, you want to go right onto the shoulder or even off the road. Going into oncoming traffic, especially on a major highway like that, is nearly certain serious injury or death. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're in a middle lane and there is traffic to your right, it's preferable to stay straight forward and hit the car in front of you, unless there's something crazy like a tractor trailer barreling at you from behind. This is because the only sensors to deploy airbags are in the front of your car. If you swerve right and someone hits you from the side, no airbags will deploy, greatly decreasing your chances of surviving without an injury (or surviving at all). Much better to rear-end the car in front of you then get T-boned if you swerve right into traffic.	While you are correct about not going into oncoming traffic, you are not correct about never going left. newlinechar  newlinechar On large highways there sometimes exist left-hand shoulders that are separated from oncoming traffic with large concrete barriers.

A ginger with arm hair? Have you told him he's an abomination? And I think Asian people in general are strangely fascinated with red hair. Same with me in India, they stared at me and came to look at my hair all the time in more rural areas, sometimes even in cities.	Oh whoah, do gingers not usually have arm hair? Personally I am pretty fascinated about any hair that is not my own color, it's so different and excitingly colorful. If my hair was the color of fire I would be so excited all day. You mention India, you travelled there? Sounds exciting.
that's why you always keep your civilian clothing :P	Hindsight is a beautiful thing haha!
Except people don't spam G2A lockons like they do Strikers, because they aren't nearly as effective overall. This wasn't an issue before the Striker.	To iterate, G2A lock-ons have worse tracking, following instead of leading the target, this results in longer overall flight time allowing for flares when they otherwise would recharge to late and more chances for scenery and ground to block the missile. newlinechar  newlinechar Also the G2G lock on has the same follow instead of lead tracking causing it to hit the ground when it comes to fast vehicles instead of hitting said vehicle and more often hitting cover instead of evading it.

&gt;  Iraq is arguably worse off than it was before newlinechar  newlinechar   You just answered your own comment. All of the points you make are based on your perception of the outcome, but you couldn't possibly know how many lives were probably saved because of those actions. newlinechar  newlinechar   So when you say 'We've killed over a hundred thousands civilians', are you comparing to that to the amount of civilians that would have likely been killed if we did not intervene? newlinechar 	According to the Lancet, between 2003-06 six hundred thousand more people died in Iraq than would have if we had not invaded. That's peer reviewed science in a good journal, but when I said Iraq was worse off due to us I wasn't just talking about body count. We destroyed their infrastructure: schools, hospitals, water treatment, power, transportation. We ruined their economy and further destabilized the region. Take a look at the rise in birth defects after the invasion. This is why I don't need a crystal ball that sees into alternate realities to say that any possible good that has come from the invasion of Iraq has not been worth the cost.

I have never seen deca cycle that short.  Deca should be run at least 15 weeks,  usually more.  Why switch to test p after 6 weeks? Test E doesn't even kick in for 4 weeks.  And such a small test p dose,  seems extremely strange.  That is like trt dose.  I can see what they wanted having it half bulk half cut but it is wrong wrong wrong.  Especially for a first cycle. I should also add that clen should not be ran 6 weeks straight.  This is wrong in every way.  Do research and if you want to run AAS do test E for 12+ weeks,  maybe do dbol or drol for the first 4. Simple and it works. 	Hey thanks man, I've been having a hard time keeping the science straight

Thank you. Somebody posted videos of the meeting elsewhere in the thread, and they clearly don't know cat body language. They aren't making friends, they're watching each other's every move and behaving defensively. newlinechar  newlinechar They're not dogs and probably don't like being 'introduced' to other cats much.	Those cats don't look particularly stressed either though. Not happy or excited, but not stressed or defensive either. They don't understand that they're being exploited, they just know that they're being fed and have a place to poop and sleep. If it's something they do a lot, travelling and meeting new animals won't stress them out too much.
not a fan of either, but i'd take hilton hands down. better qb, better offense, younger. aging speed receivers (wallace) don't age well, imo. newlinechar also, i think wayne/hilton complement each other, not hurt each other. wayne is bigger but trending towards 'posession wr' territory (e.g. intermediate routes); hilton's specialty is the deep route.	Surprisingly, I'm a fan of both. For an experienced receiver like Wallace, I think where he is getting drafted is fair. They just don't dish out that amount of cash for someone who isn't going to be a huge part of their defense. Hilton on the other hand has a huge ceiling, he could potentially be the next breakout WR and could be 3rd round value. newlinechar  newlinechar In this situation, I would take Hilton by only a little. Even though he is the 3rd receiver on the depth chart, I think he is going to be terrific value at his currently late 6th-early 7th draft spot. newlinechar  newlinechar Just reread OP's post, what team league are you in where Hilton is on the bench?
But you still have to rein them in once in a while, and not let them run wild. 	I knew this would spur some discussion.
They went head to head in the 95 finals. That's why I brought it up.	You're right, my NBA history was lacking. Although I suppose it matters that Shaq was 3 years out of college and Hakeem was in his prime.
Im the same. When i'm with my friends I wont think twice about calling them retards and fuck ups as a joke, but i'd never do it to a girl and if I did i'd still be sweet instead of yelling it like i would to my friend.	I go a lot further than this. With nerdy friends I'm a huge nerd. With more attractive popular guys I act more like a ladies man. With quiet people I'm quiet, with loud people I'm loud.
It might help to dress below your age.  Some people can get away with looking like an 11 year old boy when they can't get away with looking like a 20 year old man.	I do, I think; button-up t-shirts, band tees, and straight-leg jeans. Too short to ever be taken as being over the age of about 13.
Dansko clogs have a thick rubber sole that provides both cushioning and support. The footbed is molded to adjust your posture to help minimize lower back pain. They are easily cleaned, slip resistant, and last forever. 	All of this, and I'll add the safety value of having shoes that very easily slip off (in case you spill something hot or something). 
Ive read this 3 times and I still dont understand it. Youre married and living in the same house but your husband has a gf?	open marriage.
Yeap, because all that fecal matter got sprayed right onto your toothbrush.	It did whether the lid was closed or not.

If you're on /r/AskReddit/new enough, you're bound to see JonAudette telling people they need to kill themselves or talking about how much he wants to commit suicide. It's kind of sad, actually.	Yeah that's sad.  Life is too much fun to be miserable or try and make others miserable.  
[He got life without parole](http://www.khou.com/news/Waller-man-who-killed-his-family-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-without-parole-164900216.html)	ah thanks.  would love to see an interview at some point in the future.  
yeah, Spencer staying before him is somewhat surprising given he was pretty good last year and has the same versatility that Spencer has.	I really thought he was gonna win the center spot, and AT LEAST stay on as a backup as a guard or center
Edit: I had revealed the show and character, but a few people now are still making their way through that glorious TV show, and have been spoiled by the answer, and nobody deserves that. So I took it down. Google will let you know what Obama's favourite show and character are if you really need to know.	Ah man, that scene. Ugh. I gotta re-watch the wire now.
Damn, you were sexy.	How come I never heard that back then?! But thanks for saying it now. Seriously. That's awesome =) 
&gt; I'm an introvert on my way to almost becoming a hermit! newlinechar  newlinechar That's pretty much how I would sum up my situation in college. There's something that's so soothing about locking my door, closing my curtains and drinking as much tea as it's humanly possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar The outside world is evil.

Instead of tea, though, my addiction was hot chocolate (which was *not* something I needed...XD). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The outside world is evil. My bedroom is a safe heaven. newlinechar  newlinechar Amen! The outside world can also be realllly awkward and embarrassing...nope, it's better to stay in my room where I can observe other people through a T.V. or computer screen!
The pink bear is very significant after the plane crash in the show. Forgive me for not remembering which episodes. More recently people have been finding OTHER identical pink bears hidden throughout the show. Easter Eggs if you will. 	All of the 'other' pink bears were easter eggs before the plane crash happened.
Inverting an emote of a nigger pone makes you racist.	no u
Though I trust RT on most reviewed movies, and i haven't seen the Katy Perry movie. That [One Direction](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/this_is_us/) movie is at a 68%, so i don't know if i can trust it on pop singer documentaries.  	I was taken aback when I found out that the One Direction documentary was directed by none other than [Morgan Spurlock of Super Size Me fame](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1041597). He still seems like a reputable guy, but seriously?
The show started like last month I think. 9 weeks ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Dude I think you're way behind. After Bakemonogatari it's Nisemonogatari. After that it's a prequel called Nekomonogatari:Kuro. Then this came out. Everything happening this season takes place after Nisemonogatari.	Wait no I am confused more again. newlinechar  newlinechar The last I watched was the 4 episodes about Black Hanakawa and it ended with her living with Aragai's sisters because her house burned down.
Please, keep the cooldown when Tyr switch stances, like Hel or buff Hel lol	Hel halves her cooldowns when she switches and the same should be done for tyr.
Wait this is a movie? newlinechar  newlinechar Damn, I missed the montage where they buckle down, and magically transform from mediocre to world-class in minutes with the awesome song in the background! newlinechar  newlinechar Thats like, the best part..	Damn, you missed super week and the first 2 days of Pax????
It was an amazing ult to me because they essentially HAD to stand in his ult. Elise had gone ahead and if they had just let her die, the rest of tsm could have chased them down 5v4. Vulcun probably hoped for more than just 2 kills, but they just didnt get it. 	Well except for Zuna, he could've easily gone without standing in the ult and saved himself at least 500 health.  You can see him move out of the ult, then move forward back into the ult to autoattack, as if he has Urgot range instead of lategame Tristana.  
Well, I'm probably not as drunk as most people. 	Don't worry I got ya
roar-audio wasn't very nice. If you like New Girl, I think another show you'd consider a must-see would be The Mindy Project. You have time to watch the first season before the next one kicks off, too.	Yeah, his response was bizarre. He must be having a bad day. newlinechar  newlinechar I'll definitely check out the Mindy Project! Need something to hold me off 'til the new season of New Girl anyway.
Queen.	Queen who?!
No problem. I think Xenophon's incredibly underrated, I love getting other people to read his stuff!	Yeah, I only knew Socrates through Plato's writing previously. This is great! newlinechar  newlinechar I will note that the close of that chapter is somewhat terpy: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; âBut, by Jupiter,â exclaimed Socrates, âI do not wish that I should be drawn to you, but that you should come to me.â âI will come then,â said she, âonly take care to let me in,â âI will let you in,â replied he, âif another more acceptable than you be not within.â newlinechar  newlinechar Kinda badass, that. I haven't 'seen' Socrates with women much. He seems to prefer the company of bright young men in most cases, heh.
I never heard of Wofford until it appeared on Baylor's schedule 	They've actually been doing very well in their division recently. The only reason I know of them is because my fiancÃ©'s old school (he transferred to Baylor) played against them. They are in the southern conference and they are ranked number 5 in the FCS right now. newlinechar  newlinechar -but then again, we are kicking their butt.
WHoa, thank you!	No problem Alex, Todd and Erson. I'll remember *you* most Erson.

It fucked me up a little, I won't lie.	I remember reading that book late into the night and then thinking that I only had a bit left to go so might as well finish it. Terrible idea. Spent the rest of the night wide awake contemplating my own inescapable eventual demise.

Palestinian here. Family all over the Levant and some merely hours from the massacre. We want Assad out, and we dgaf about israels involvement, they treat us better than most Arabs do. Let's not play arm chair diplomats when we have no idea what we're talking about. 	Funny. My close Palestinian friends (whose family lives in Syria) says the opposite. He has not but disdain for Israel and respect for Assad. Everyone has a different opinion. 
I have to disagree. SC2 is massively popular in Korea ATM. The only 'stats' people can quote are the PC bang usage ones. Because of the demographic SC2 targets (young professionals who don't live at home) a good percentage of South Korea plays SC2 from home. They have no need to deal with parents, family, school, etc so they have no need to go to PC bangs. Downsizing can be healthy, sure, but SC2 isn't downsizing. Thanks to Blizzard intervening with their full support of eSports the playerbase of SC2 is as healthy as ever and is far from going down the path of games that ARE actually dying.	you got any source on your claim that sc2 is massively popular in korea?
what the actual fuck	Right?! newlinechar  newlinechar Is that serious?! Holy smokes!
Thanks man.  newlinechar  newlinechar Talking about anything that can be construed as a physical feat on reddit is going to be an attractor of downvotes, mainly because people are so used to reflexively downvoting the guys who respond to things, 'Bro, I could totally handle that shit, I was an elite sniper trained in 'gorilla' warfare, and I'm gunna pwn you.' newlinechar  newlinechar I think anything that isn't a joke that can be seen as boasting about something is going to draw downvotes, but a bunch of guys have asked for advice, and while I'm no guru, I'm glad I can help people make decisions that will benefit them in the long run. In the end, that's a lot more meaningful than my karmic ratio, haha.	&gt; I think anything that isn't a joke that can be seen as boasting about something is going to draw downvotes newlinechar  newlinechar This is such an accurate statement that it's sad. I see this sort of mentality regarding other things on here also. You didn't seem boastful to me, just honest and sharing your experience. I'm a female but I thought what you had to say was interesting, too! Ideas I'm familiar with, but I love getting another person's perspective. You got me thinking :).  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Also, I think I pissed someone off. After I made that comment someone went through and downvoted everything in my history haha. Wow. 
&gt;It seems a bit odd of him to give himself a whole book + subsequent talks as his argumentative tools, then limit his detractors to a mere 1000 words. newlinechar  newlinechar Really, now? It doesn't seem odd to me in the slightest. I'm honestly surprised he allowed for that much space.	Are you surprised because you don't think Harris is genuinely open to objections or because you think 1000 words is more than enough space to refute substantive arguments?
Wat?	I'm not sure I understand the question either.
not in the laws passed here, it was touted as a union busting bill, but they stripped a lot of employee rights here in Indiana. We were already at will, but they stripped a lot of our ability to sue for wrongful termination and such.

Couple setting questions: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) How often do Night Hunters go out past the wall? Is it a fairly often event or rare? By the sounds of it they also double as bodyguards for travel/trade between cities; is most of this horse/foot travel or more magically means? newlinechar  newlinechar 2) How do the populace view the Night Hunters? Is there much interest in recolonization or are people content/feeling safe behind the walls? Are they seen on the same level as the Garrison (guys manning the walls) or are they were the lower trainees go? newlinechar  newlinechar 3) For Divine casters do they have specific Domain restrictions due to 'Light' being the only accepted Deity? newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Core Races only or are all fair game? Darkvision races allowed?	Good questions! From the top then: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Fairly frequently. Most travel is done by foot - Horses are a bit of a scarce commodity, and traveling exceedingly long distances with magic is infeasible, not to mention unsafe if it's not point to point. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) The population reveres the Night Hunters, as they're the only thing standing between them and a messy, gruesome death from the night creatures overrunning the walls. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) It's fairly general, subject to approval on a case by case basis. I honestly don't even think that the Darkness domain is off limits if you can justify it. newlinechar  newlinechar 4) They've solved that via itemized darkvision. All standard core races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, etc.) only.

You keep tasting that metallic tang, is it still bleeding?  What if you poke your tongue in there and it gets poked by a sharp bit of tooth left behind.

I like huge crazy numbers and spec lists quite a bit but honestly if the phone works well then it doesnt matter. So I guess I'm with the Moto X in that regard. The thing that worries me with that phone is the camera. All the photos seem underexposed and dull.	That is true with the Moto X's camera, but it could just be a processing issue. This can easily be fixed with a firmware update. On the other hand, the S4 does take amazing photos.

Interesting, so where they following you around w/o arresting all that time to draw out your comrades?  newlinechar  newlinechar What kind of fake documents? 	Yes they took pictures and filmed me, as I saw in the trial, and everybody who I met during that time was questioned by the police. This was the reason and also to document everything I did, so they can be sure that I will get prison, and not some probation. And as far as the first cops were concerned, when they saw I was leaving their country, they arranged for the others to catch me. newlinechar And when I think about it, maybe it was better that they took me the moment I arrived there, because if they were set up to follow me for a couple of days, I would have been in a worse situation. newlinechar All kinds of documents, personal, corporate.

Is this really your argument? We don't know 100% everything so we should just sit on our ass and do nothing while thousands of innocent civilians are slaughtered by a dictator because they aren't the same religion as him?	Around 90,000 people have died in the Syrian civil war.  About 1,500 from chemical weapons.  I'm saying that this shouldn't be the stimulus that pushes us into the conflict.  If you feel that the US has a moral obligation to intervene in foreign conflicts that threaten the lives of civilians, then that's your stance, and I'm sure there are many people who agree with you. newlinechar  newlinechar But killing is what people do.  Mao Zedong was responsible for about 76 million deaths, Chinggis Kahn - 40 million, Stalin - 23 million, Hitler - 17 million, Leopold II - 15 million, and the list goes on.  If you start studying history you'll learn all sorts of horrible things humans have done to each other on massive scales.  Now I'm not arguing that the atrocities committed in the past somehow excuse current and future atrocities, but somehow expecting that they won't continue to happen, or that we're capable of preventing them all is just naive.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for Syria, my heart goes out to those suffering in the conflict, but I feel no obligation to endanger the strength and safety of my country for them.  The good guy doesn't always win.

Or maybe its more common than you think, but you've only been exposed to porn with small, pink vaginas, big breasts with petite nipples and fake blonde hair. Women vary quite a lot in body structure.

When the US invaded Afghanistan, the Taliban was the ruling government. It was the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as ruled by the Taliban. newlinechar  newlinechar There was no other government there, so they would have to be the defacto government. If some foreign Government, or business, wanted to do something in Afghanistan, they would have been dealing with the Taliban. newlinechar  newlinechar The UN even dealt with them, in 2000 they struck up a deal to stop opium, and the output went from 4500 tonnes in 1999 to less than 50 tonnes by the end of 2000. It was considered unIslamic. newlinechar  newlinechar So suffice it to say, the Taliban was considered the Afghani government at the time. It should also be noted that at the time, the Taliban Gov't did not support Al Qaeda. It wasn't until the US invaded that the Taliban teamed up with Al Qaeda.	1. The Taliban was never recognized by any external organization as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Only a few dubious countries ventured an endorsement.  newlinechar  newlinechar 2.

That you would even come out here without confirming the details I mentioned in advance, or claim that a lover would play ball right until the last second even though she knew you would fly out here with allegedly everything on your back, looks very suspicious. But if you are willing to come forward and verify details, I can be swayed.

It looks like it's three layers plus the hood thingy over the shoulders. My interpretation of the leather 'flaps' is that it's part of a long sleeveless vest. newlinechar  newlinechar I shouldn't be that hard to do. The thing that will take the longest is to get the leather 'edge trimming' on the wool 'tabard' and 'hood'. You might want to skip that. You could always fix it later. newlinechar  newlinechar The leather on the upper arms might also take some hard work to get right. Working with padded leather is hard work. newlinechar  newlinechar I thing you should do it. But you might consider some simplifications. You could always upgrade it later.	Thanks for the input. My understanding of those 'flaps' are that they could be part of a long cloth shirt. The site I linked actually mentions that the shirt goes beyond knee length, but this would not make them leather.  newlinechar  newlinechar I see what you mean about the trimming, I'll probably mod it so I don't have that on there, or so it more simply. I'm also thinking of forgoing the leather shoulder armour, but keep the bracers of course.

It's a design decision. They don't want people just silently matching up with others and teleporting to dungeons as it's done in WoW, for example. You still have to talk and socialise with your group and get your character to dungeons, which to be fair requires very minimal effort considering how well connected the dungeons are with waypoints.	During the design discussions on LFG, it was decided early on that we wanted it to be something that facilitated and promoted community, instead of turning it into a 'queue to play with people you will never see again' feature.  I think we've done that, but time will tell.  I'm extremely proud of the tool.
After cases involving Brett Stewart and Ben Teo i think he deserves the assumption of innocent until guilty. Plus that photo of the 'Bloodied lip' looks faker than a supermodels tits.	There's no such thing as consensual sex if you're a public figure.

I go a lot further than this. With nerdy friends I'm a huge nerd. With more attractive popular guys I act more like a ladies man. With quiet people I'm quiet, with loud people I'm loud.

That's kind of funny, because I learned best with teachers and tutors with difficult accents. The downside is that certain areas of Math, I still only can think about if my mental voice uses the thickest Indian accent it can imagine.	To be fair, I don't hold this against her because of her accent.  My (life-saving) tutor was Indian. newlinechar  newlinechar She just simply lacked the vocabulary to explain anything.  She would (stiltedly) explain the fact that enumerative combinatorics existed, but was entirely unable to explain what the hell it was. newlinechar  newlinechar Our lectures with her were amazingly short because of this.  They largely consisted of 'enumerative combinatorics is important,' and then explaining that other such concepts existed.  Never any explanation of what the fuck they actually were. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't necessarily think it was solely due to the language barrier.  In the few conversations with her I could understand, it was clear that she was EXCEPTIONALLY intelligent.  For her, these concepts were second nature and needed no explanation.  The fact that she lacked the vocabulary to explain them was secondary.  She saw no need for explanation. newlinechar  newlinechar

I don't think you can win it all with Love as far and away as your best player. He's a really bad defender and that's a huge deal because he's playing PF, which means your're going to have to find some sorta elite defensive Center to pair next to him. Offensively, he is amazing. Great efficeiny, amazing offensive rebounding, and can stretch the floor. That being said, I'm not sure that his shot-creation skills are good enough to be the #1 over a full post-season. I mean, I don't think he's a dominant 'give me the ball and GTFO my way' type ala Barkley/Jordan/Kobe/Wade/LBJ or even a peak Duncan. I think he's a guy who relies more on being set up. Overall, he might be better suited to be a #2 guy ala Gasol. He'd be a perfect fit on a team like the current Bulls.	Exactly what I've been saying! I really hope Love remains healthy and gets a ticket to the Bulls/finals.

I think it's really quite close to the real thing. I haven't tried other soaps like this, but when I looked around for other people's opinions, they said most others aren't this close. Don't judge the smell until you've lathered it! The soap itself is quite soft. I cut the puck in half and mashed one half into the bottom of my mug. The lather itself is really luxurious. They say it's 'thirsty', but that's not a big deal. It lathers quickly and abundantly. At $11, I say go for it. Or get a sampler. When mine arrived, it came with a sample of Seville, but I haven't given it a go yet.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've only tried a handful of soaps because I only got into wetshaving this past summer (TOBS grapefruit, col conk, and QCS Iced Key Lime), and I daresay this is my new favorite. Unlike the QCS, which I also really like, this is good year round. 	Thanks for the response! i really appreciate your feedback. how'd you like ye TOBS grapefruit? That's the other one I wanted to try. I have hard water so I figured a cream would be better for me. Plus, I have a body butter that's grapefruit and it's the most amazing scent. 
And the new resource, 'Meld' is not going to change this. newlinechar  newlinechar What is going to happen is that on high difficulties, most of the time you are simply going to have to abandon the Meld. If it's difficult to obtain, and requires risking people, then it simply isn't worthwhile. Because of the focus on soldier leveling, those troops are not expendable.  newlinechar  newlinechar If a mission spawns where Meld can be obtained with minimal risk, then the player will capitalize on the opportunity, but otherwise the Ironman Impossible player is just going to ignore it. newlinechar  newlinechar The fundamental problem is with the way enemies spawn. Giving players an incentive to move quickly and take risks won't change the fact that the game's fundamental structure STRONGLY discourages that play style. To fix this, have all the enemies placed on the map at the start of the battle, and have all enemies able to move, shoot, surprise you, etc. Players will still want to keep it tight, but will want to move fast and get as much vision as possible instead of conga line three tiles for 1000 turns.	This is firaxis making the expansion though, and look at how much they changed or improved the mechanics of civ5 with each expansion, so I'm going to have hope for now that they can improve its issues.

People like to actively pursue some type of goal in a game, and DayZ doesn't seem to have one. It all leads to getting the bigger gun and killing other players it seems..	As I've said if you go in with that kind of mindset then you are not playing games right especially not this game.  newlinechar  newlinechar The goal of Dayz is not the get the best gun and kill other players.The goal in Dayz is to create nerve wreaking excitement and terror(see quote from Barry Lopez's 'Flight') and to create an environment that encourages cooperation but at the same time rewards selfishness.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now I'm not going to say that Dayz nailed it on its execution but this was the point of the game or at least the best way to create an interesting game out of the mechanics established.  newlinechar  newlinechar Dayz does have a goal its just a bit more abstract than a list of quests/missions.

Thanks for showing us your true self. You're beautiful. I was bullied relentlessly as a kid. I grew up thinking I was not good enough. This lead me to marrying an SO who was very cold and judgmental to me but loved by everyone else he met. I felt lucky that one of the perfect people picked me. I ignored how he made me feel about who I was at heart.   I read your story I feel the shame that I felt about myself that has effected every decision I made in my life. I fear you may turn around 20 years later like  I have and realize how much that Shame has damaged your life. Please find someone to talk to. Please so you can go on and have a great adult life loving YOU. 	Thank you for relating. I'm sorry to hear how things worked out for you. Shame is such a messy thing to deal with and we're true warriors for having to face it. I'm 22 right now and my only goal in life right now is to deal with this shame, and it has been tough. What kind of people do you recommend I talk to? The shame makes it hard for me to reach out. I relive the rejection and humiliation of my childhood days every day. I see it in the way people look at me, the way they talk to me. In the things they say and even the things that they don't say. I find it hard to find 'safe' people.

Fucking- Pixar can't pull off 'real'?! Did you see Wall-E? Dark storyline aside it looked like most of the Earth scenes were live action.	An AI making jokes about killing scientists with neurotoxin during a 'Bring your kid to work day' and how the main character is unwanted by her parents is far from as dark as WALL-E was. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is, Portal isn't something that could easily be made a movie out of, and releasing it by a company that only makes children-appropriate movies would be a disaster.

are you in the US? didn't think they would cover benign removals...	Yes, I am. It's probably not far off to think that is correct, but if you have good insurance ($$$) and 'good' doctors, you should be able to. I originally looked it up online and found the documentation for my provider on the exact subject and the requirements for coverage. newlinechar  newlinechar It only covers the removal of actual breast tissue and not any liposuction, which is done a lot of times if you're going the 'cosmetic' route. But luckily I'm pretty damn fit (or else I wouldn't be here) so I don't need that. newlinechar  newlinechar Mine states that it needs to be a hinderance to everyday life, but it's description is vague. This is where the good doctor thing plays in. My doctor is one you can go to and he'll prescribe you pretty much anything without trouble, but I've read a lot of stories on Reddit where docs refuse to write scripts for things in the US. I also have paper trail to back my claim, because I first brought this to the attention of my doctor, on record, at age 16 and that helps my case. I'm 23 now. newlinechar  newlinechar With mine, you need to get your doctor's approval, and then the case is sent to the insurance company for verification. I had to go through the same thing to get my deviated septum fixed. You get examined by your doctor and they determine if it warrants a case. So...have a 'good' doctor. newlinechar  newlinechar Mine really is a hinderance though. It's not like I have huge man boobs, more puffy, conical nips, but I do have decently sized chunks of tissue. It's painful just slipping a shirt over these suckers and moving around, probably because it's so tight against my pecs. Also, I've had, um, secretions from one of them (yeah, I know). I was sitting on the toilet taking a shit when I felt some dampness on my shirt. Sure enough, I squeezed my nip and liquid came out. That was the final straw, and the start of my attempt to remove it. newlinechar  newlinechar My medical group has an in-house plastic surgeon (she's a regular board-certified surgeon) that is going to do it. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically you can't do it if it's only for cosmetic reasons, so being uncomfortable with your body isn't a reason enough. Your mileage may vary, though. newlinechar 
Thank you! My daughter sleeps in her big girl bed now because she liked to jump out of her crib. I've resorted to blockading her in a corner with chairs for her time-outs. Does your son cry during his time out? My daughter cries the ENTIRE TIME and hits stuff and its just a mess. I try to keep it down to a 1 minute time out but I feel like if she is hitting the wall or me when I take her out that I should just leave her in until she calms down. What do you think?	He does cry while in time out. Usually he knows it's coming when I pick him up and head to his room. I hate it, but I know he's okay. He's just frustrated. If I go in there after a minute and he's slapping at my arms or still being mean, I'll say, 'Okay, I'll leave you in here another minute then.' And go from there. newlinechar  newlinechar For my son, there is not really the option of leaving him in his room until he calms down. It used to work like that, but for the past couple months he just works himself up more. So I rinse and repeat, lol. It takes some time, depending, but results definitely start to show through :]

I forgot to add above that apparently the mom had had CPS called on her before, and I knew nothing about it, I also was a licensed child care provider at the time, so I legally HAD to report any suspected abuse. She had never had her kids taken away before. So there was already info on her and the girls. The 2 year old was not found with bruises, but had drugs in her system, they wouldn't tell me what kind. I don't know where the fathers were. My 'friend' made them sound like deadbeats. I don't know where they ended up, CPS couldn't tell me anything.

What is the difference between casting and smelting?	Basically when you have liquid metal and pour it into some kind of mould then it's casting. While it's relatively easy to do with soft metals, like copper, that's not easy to do with iron and that's not how steel was made in ancient times. They didn't have the tech to attain the high temperatures needed to completely liquefy iron and pour it into a mould (like our modern industry does). Instead they used charcoal to reduce the oxygen from the ore and then pounded the resulting bloom in order to reduce impurities.

Nah, you just need to think of this: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-hidden-costs-of-index-funds-2011-7 	from the article: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The study examines the ways that stock prices change between the time that it is announced that a company will be added or removed from a stock index (such as the S&amp;P500) and when the companyÃ¢â¬â¢s stock is actually added.Ã  The research suggests that canny institutional investors can make a profit in this period that results in a drag on performance for index fund investors. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You do know that changing the list of companies in the S&amp;P 500 happens only like 5 times a year or so right?  newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies#Recent_changes_to_the_list_of_S.26P_500_Components newlinechar  newlinechar And that's out of 500 companies!

I agree with this guy , I started way back In the day playing BF on a PC then I switched over to console . You guys think that we don't know that our version is not inferior ? But he is right the amount of elitism is Nuts!	Sometimes it's deadly serious elitism and the person feels better about themselves when they do it. Other times it's friendly ribbing about the differences between the console and PC versions. newlinechar  newlinechar At the end of the day, it's not a big deal. When more people discover something, it can feel like it's starting to drift away from you, your crowd, and what originally attracted you to the game. I don't like the CoD style marketing and paying for maps, but I'll take it if it means more money is spent developing the game and there are more players to play it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Part of the problem is that BF2 had a really, really good community that consoles just can't hold a candle to. And that same sense of community never really formed for Battlefield 3. Part of that is by design, as the game isn't meant to last years and EA won't hand out mod tools. But part of it was the demographic shift and a lot of new players not understanding where the game's roots were. newlinechar  newlinechar I can still find some shreds of great community out there and have the game appeal to me. And console players can have their community and a game that works for them. I'm excited for console players that will get to experience increased map size and player counts for the first time. The platforms starting to resemble one another is a good thing for everyone.

Well, take into account it's not considered that the PC completes all the quests, just the main ones (Alduin, Dawnguard, Dragonborn). I guess you should take into account of the Nerevarine [if he's still on Tamriel] since he killed 2 gods, an aspect of a Daedric prince and cannot die via age or disease. Also Divayth Fyr *should* be taken into account, though he may have been knocked off in the Red Year. newlinechar  newlinechar Also Vivec, he's mortal now and definitely high up on the list. If only Cyrus were still alive, he'd be the guy you're looking for	I'm not sure if the Nerevarine would fit his criteria since he's immortal now, right? Even still, I think that the Nerevarine would be one of the few to give the Dragonborn a run for his money.

exception, not the rule	It is the rule for well maintained motorcycles. Find another motorcycle with more then 20k miles with the original owner and all service records - that alone is rare. The only exception here is an original owner actually riding a motorcycle that much, not the fact that the engine lasted that long given proper maintenance.  newlinechar  newlinechar As I pointed out elsewhere, the average motorcycle sees less then 2k miles a year, that would mean the owner would need to own the motorcycle 10 years to get that many miles. The fact is more people don't own vehicles that long, and don't ride that much, and many don't maintain their motorcycle that well. Properly maintained bikes last much longer then you think. newlinechar

I was figuring more that, while growing up, timeline B's Hachikuji, who didn't exist in the original timeline, would create enough changes to subtly alter things for eleven years before Bake even happened.  As such, compared to eleven years ago, Bake is late in the timeline.  I refer to her as an extra Hachikuji because she's alive and kicking and influencing events instead of being dead and only showing up to mislead people every so often.

I don't regret it at all, because in the long run it helped my dad realize what he had gotten himself in to. He confessed to me afterward that he was letting his sex drive take control of his decisions. He's Mormon, so if he wanted to get laid he had to be married. She turned out to be a psycho bitch who threatened to kill all of my dad's kids in their sleep. I was out of town when that happened, or else I might have been brought up on murder charges for strangling her.	Wow, sounds exactly like my boyfriend's mother. She no longer has custody of any of her kids and none of her family speaks to her.

It just seems like blizzard makes the wrong decisions a lot of the time, and that they are just too slow to react vs what Riot and what Valve are doing with their Moba's and their interface. newlinechar  newlinechar It took them over a year to remove close spawns and put in maps that are actually half decent maps on the ladder or some that were used in tournaments.

Seems to me like the distances would balance themselves out.  newlinechar  newlinechar I.E: if the bases were 100 feet apart it'd take a runner longer to get to first but you'd also have more travel distance before a ball reaches a fielder's glove, and they'd need stonger arms to make difficult throws.  newlinechar  newlinechar Same with basestealing, it's already hard enough as it is of for a catcher to throw somebody out at second, add another 13 feet to that (if my math is correct) and it'll balance out the longer running distance.  newlinechar  newlinechar 	People throw a lot faster than anyone can run so the added distance is not equal.  newlinechar  newlinechar Even if the fielders didn't move an inch from where they'd normally play they would have way more time to make a play while the runner has more ground to cover. Bobbled balls would still give the fielder ample time to complete a play. Throws could be less rushed therefore more accurate. Fewer bare-handed plays would be necessary. That's not even considering how they could prepare depth wise based on the hitter.

Hint: is the system linear?  What does that mean about forces at angles?  What does that mean about effective spring constants?	I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at. The spring force is linear with respect to the displacement of the spring, but the displacement of the spring isn't linear with respect to changes in theta. This is really where I am getting confused. I don't see how there can be a general simplification that explains how a spring force (at any angle) is dependent only on the angle theta. newlinechar  newlinechar

Plus, if you can convince a few friends to get it, dicking around with them is always a lot of fun.	Thanks for the reply. Do you, by chance, know how long the Amazon sale is going to last for?

I really don't want to discourage you from getting a treatment that MAY possibly be a life changing (for the better) event for you. BUT please be aware it could also make things worse, I had L3-L5 fused in march of 2002 due to a injury and while before the surgery I was in pain, had some nerve damage and was generally not doing great, since the surgery I've been, to put it plainly, fucked. I had unexpected bone growth from the fusion site, that has grown around my cord and up my vertebra, to the extent where it has popped two more discs, and that site will now need to be eventually fused as well, and the growth around my cord is growing thicker over time pretty much guaranteeing that I will need to have a neurosurgeon go in and cut it out. My right leg doesn't have any feeling anymore really due to the nerve damage I suffered but the increased bone growth has also retarded it from any chance of healing. The donor site where they took my graft bone from has grown back oddly to say the least, and is causing problems from the growth, and I have bone spurs in both hips most likely caused by the bone growth stimulation. newlinechar  newlinechar Add on to this pile of shit the fact that I'm on several narcotics that Id rather not be on but will most likely have to take for the rest of my life (and these come with their own pile of joyous side effects, like killing my testosterone production, fucking up my thyroid, depression etc). This all happened when I was 28... I'm retired now, get around with a cane and a lot of pain on my good days, on my bad days I don't get out of bed. If I didn't have the support system I have I don't think I'd be able to have lasted this long. newlinechar  newlinechar Please keep in mind before my fusion I did NO research, I trusted doctors implicitly, mostly because of being gut shot and having been through a 100+ major surgeries when I was younger and having turned out almost good as new at the end. But after my surgery it seemed I couldn't go a day without encountering someone who had a fusion and had 'complications'. I wish I had just researched a little, now of course I'm a huge pain the ass for all the medical profession because I'm hyper vigilant about everything, but you know the old saying about horses and barn doors right. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously you have to choose for yourself, just please make an informed choice and good luck either way.	While my heart breaks because of the shit you've gone through, I really appreciate you taking the time to let me know what you've been through.   newlinechar  newlinechar My injuries are not because of any sort of accident or episode.  I simply have the back of an 80 year old.  I have degenerative disc disease and 3 herniations in my lumbar area.  Before my previous surgery, I was unable to walk or hold down any sort of job (not many people want to hire someone who is hopped up on painkillers and unable to walk).   newlinechar  newlinechar I have seen 3 neurosurgeons (8 doctors and 6 physical therapists as well) to help me with my back.  The 3 neurosurgeons are all on the same page, which is comforting.  I know that the fusion can be very risky, but as a 28 year old who loves hiking, biking, and being outdoors, I am almost positive I will choose fusion over the life I lead now.   newlinechar  newlinechar Today was a beautiful summer day and I have been basically bed-bound except for getting ice packs out of the freezer and going to the  bathroom.   newlinechar  newlinechar Best of luck to you in the future.

In the US, we spend $50 million (or $150 million) to build a high school campus, while other countries simply educate their children - which costs very little.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think it was rather pointless to 'study' those particular students: a young person who independently raises $10k to go to school in another country is beyond exceptional. And students from other countries attending a US school with 40 students is representative of nothing. newlinechar

&gt; My plane was to come in at 2:15 newlinechar  newlinechar What airline? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, is somebody picking this guy up? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, contact the Stranger: editor@thestranger.com. If legit, this is probably worth some sort of an article, or at least a Slog post. Someone who leads someone on that far without spilling the beans probably should be outed. newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly, I'm not buying your story. There are too many people in this town who beg for money and lodging with fabricated stories a lot like this one. I do not put it past anyone to come on reddit and make something like this up to milk some people for what they can. That you would even come out here without confirming the details I mentioned in advance, or claim that a lover would play ball right until the last second even though she knew you would fly out here with allegedly everything on your back, looks very suspicious. But if you are willing to come forward and verify details, I can be swayed.

Ugh... this is what happens when journalists try to explain computer science.  newlinechar  newlinechar OK, let me try and do a better job. First the examples: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Rick Rashid was understandably nervous. As he stepped onto the stage to address 2000 researchers and students in Tianjin, China, he was risking ridicule. He did not speak Chinese, and his translator's poor skills in the past promised embarrassment. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'We hope that in a few years we'll be able to break down the language barriers between people,' the senior vice-president of Microsoft Research told the audience. There was a tense two-second pause before the translator's voice came through. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Rashid continued: 'Personally, I believe this is going to lead to a better world.' Pause, repeat in Chinese. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;He smiled. The crowd were applauding every line. Some people even cried. This seemingly overenthusiastic reaction was understandable: Rashid's translator had come far. Every sentence was understood and delivered flawlessly. And the most impressive part? The translator was not human. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;These intelligent algorithms are beginning to influence every realm of life. A month after Rashid's speech, for example, the Netherlands Forensic Institute, in The Hague, employed a machine-learning system called Bonaparte to help find a murder suspect who had evaded capture for 13 years. newlinechar  newlinechar So far so good, many examples of soft AI working in the real word. newlinechar  newlinechar But here is where things get confusing: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Here, roughly, is how it works. Many of the most successful machine-learning systems are built on Bayesian statistics, a mathematical framework that lets us measure likelihood. It puts a number to the plausibility of an outcome, given the context and previously observed correlations in similar contexts. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't confuse Bayesian or other statistics with brute force machine-learning.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example, spam filtering uses a Bayesian approach to identify spam. This means that a lot of work has gone into fine tuning the Bayesian analysis of text. And then you give it a bunch of examples of spam and that's how it learns to identify them.  newlinechar  newlinechar This fine tuned machine learning is different from a brute force neural network approach. newlinechar  newlinechar A brute force approach is not fine tuned at all.  This is an example of the brute force approach trying to identify cats in Youtube videos: http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-triumph-of-artificial-intelligence-16-000-processors-can-identify-a-cat-in-a-youtube-video-sometimes/259001/ newlinechar  newlinechar Four points about the brute force approach: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. It requires shit tonnes of hardware to do anything interesting. newlinechar 2. It is not very good even with incredible amounts of shit tonnes of hardware. newlinechar 3. We don't know exactly what it is doing once it is trained. newlinechar 4. Chomsky really hates that. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now  you are asking yourself could be use a Bayesian approach to identify cats?  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes! With a bit of human fine tuning we could use a tonne less hardware and do a much better job. It would still be machine learning, we would just put more intelligence into it first. Also we would know exactly how and why it works. newlinechar  newlinechar Chomsky does not have a problem with that. newlinechar  newlinechar Now you are asking yourself, then what is the point of brute force neural network machine learning? newlinechar  newlinechar There really is no point yet. newlinechar  newlinechar At some point in the future affordable hardware could be so powerful that we could use to to identify cats in videos as well as a  human or better. And do it all with absolutely no extra human effort.  newlinechar  newlinechar But if we had hardware that powerful it is extremely likely we would have a true hard AI. And if we had hard AI we are well into or past the singularity and none of this shit matters anymore.  newlinechar  newlinechar But you can sort of see the elegance of being able to teach a machine to do anything just by creating a big enough neural network. And keep in mind people in the 1950s thought we'd have computers that powerful by the 1970s.   newlinechar  newlinechar And its is only when we snapped out of that dream and started doing smarter AI work, like the statistical approach, that we ended the AI winter. newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar  	I don't think that there's a line which can reasonably be drawn separating some class of machine-learning approaches that could be collectively-called 'brute force' and systems using Bayesian inference.  Bayesian inference, like most machine-learning systems, can be quite computationally-expensive expensive as well.

OP placed he vines. If they were natural, they would be the jungle green or the swampy brownish green. Instead it's the snowbiome's faded green. The vines would also be several blocks long, as they generate in the world greater than one block long.	For one, blocks such as leaves, grass and vines adopt the biome color of the biome they are placed in, whether naturally generated or not. newlinechar  newlinechar Two, from my knowledge of vines, the game chooses random places to spawn them, and they grow over time, making them appear as if they were spawned in clumps. newlinechar  newlinechar Three, I promise you I did not place the vines or the spawner. While I was walking towards the area it was night time and my first instinct was to light it up and check out the chests, but after that I decided to take a picture of this rare occurance where a spawner spawns both on ground level, and adopts the vines of the jungle biome to give it a more eerie feel.

Well, I mentioned the three inches, I'm aware of the cup size difference. But three cup sizes, three inches isn't going to triple the weight of breasts. There's no way that I'd be at four pounds of boob, and you at fifteen--because you're saying each cup size difference between us adds four pounds of boob. So, anyone smaller than me suddenly has weightless boobs! Which doesn't make sense. That's just not how mass works. newlinechar  newlinechar I think people just really overestimate the weight of things. Yes, breast glands will be different, but look at [how freaking big](http://theheavyhipster.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/img_1749.jpg) five pounds of fat really is. newlinechar  newlinechar For comparison, a *brick*, which weighs about five pounds, has the equivalent volume, if it were a pair of boobs, to somewhere between a 30G and 30GG. So unless you think your boobs are three times as dense as *bricks*, there is absolutely no way it works. Boobs float in water, they just aren't that heavy/dense.	Breasts are composed of more than fat. While not the most scientific way, I had a scale put on a counter and just kinda flopped my boobs on it. No leaning down, no hands on the scale etc. I also have a lot of fibrous tissue in my breasts which is why I think they weigh that much. 
[](/tsannoyed) And then if you say 'literally' in a case where they would expect you to be speaking figuratively, they'll assume you're being figurative. The word loses some of its power. newlinechar  newlinechar What annoys me about all of this is that we *already* have words for emphasis, and now we're turning a special assumption-overriding word into a mere term of emphasis, and there isn't really any other word to replace its role. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't blindly try to perserve the status quo -- I just want a decently-structured language. newlinechar  newlinechar On that note, does anyone feel like trying to introduce some new words for cases where you'd expect a remark to be an exxageration, metaphor, similie, analogy, etc, where in fact it accurately describes what happened when taken at face value?	You can use context and other words to get your meaning across. You don't have to rely on a single word to get your meaning across. newlinechar  newlinechar Also you seem to think that this is a new phenomenon in language, or that it has been  somehow deliberately inserted into it. The first recorded usage of 'literally' used to mean 'figuratively' is from the late 1760's.  newlinechar  newlinechar How come you don't have a problem with other words that have two opposite meanings, such as 'to dust' or 'to cleave'?
Au contraire, why would one disagree OP. Yeah, it isn't worded as best as it could be, but society allows people of one race to act one way that another race can't. If one wants to break down racism, they must break it down on all sides, not pick and choose based on race. Otherwise, you are supporting more racism.	That's not what racism is. Telling a white person that it is unacceptable to say the n-word is NOT racism. To call it such only trivializes actual instances of discrimination and oppression based on racial categorization.

Don't blame Blizzard for stagnate maps. They wanted more varied maps and the community and pro players pretty much lynched them for it.	I CAN blame blizzard for stagnant maps because rather than changing the races (really just zerg, maybe a bit of toss) so that they had options aside from just get on three base then macro, they chose to go the easy route of map balance. newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, remember when naturals had high ground near them? You know why those are gone? Because zerg had no pre-lair drops or range units outside of queens and spines so they had absolutely no way to deal with these strats. Rather than address this problem with the zerg race, blizz decided okay then, no more high ground at the naturals. newlinechar  newlinechar A fear of making big sweeping changes during the 'beta' led to the stagnation you saw at the end of WoL.

I feel a double side car bike is going to have both a harder time avoiding, and recovering than the jeep from the next drunk!  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I can't even imagine how much turning (or getting boxed in and having to push 1000lb of bike backwards) would suck! newlinechar 
On the money! $300 to /u/NCJake2013. You have the board, pick a category.	Oh god.  the pressure. Umm.... Ummm.... I'll take Famous Racetracks for $400!
Healthcare, pensions, vacation days, those sorts of things.	The fact that (presumably in the US..) they result from a 40 hour week is pretty frightening. Sad really, the US was on the front (with others) when it came for the fight for workers rights and indeed for the rights of all people, yet seems to have failed to actually make a lot of what would be seen as a right around the world a reality... newlinechar  newlinechar

That argument is in the article by Worthington.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you look at Khadr's history, he was born in Canada, and shipped out at something like 2 years old. He is only Canadian by loose association, really. On top of that, even though treason doesn't have an age limit (that I know of), I can't really see someone logically arguing that a, effectively brainwashed, 15 year old can commit treason.	That really just boils down to 'well I don't want Mr. Kadhr to be charged with treason due to extenuating circumstances even though by definition his actions were treason'. newlinechar  newlinechar That's soft-headed reasoning because those circumstances are something on considers in *sentencing*.  They don't change his citizenship, (no matter how much the anti-Kadhr folks might it wish so) and they don't change his actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Mr. Kadhr is either a Canadian citizen or he is not.  If he is not, then the US should drop him off back in Afghanistan and let them deal with him. newlinechar  newlinechar But of course that's a problem, (and any advocate for Mr. Kadhr will say it is), because Mr. Kadhr *is* a Canadian citizen.  That means that by fighting against Canada he committed treason. newlinechar  newlinechar His age, his nasty family, and his time spent outside Canada are all factors when considering appropriate punishments, (not to mention his time already spent in prison), but they don't change his citizenship and they don't change who he was fighting against.
Stop it, you're being anal.	Guys, we should all just put this *behind* us.
This isn't Ole Miss or someone in-conference. It is fucking Rice. Scoreboard isn't that effective. 	If the defense is talking shit after you score on them, I'd say scoreboard too.
Or you can buy 500 regular tee's for 5$. Idk it just seems like a total waste of money to me,	This is a pack of 20 plastic tees for $5.   newlinechar They sent out free packs to ~10 redditors to try out.
[](/fs26)I was in shock.	I'm sorry 
I was informed there'd be Indiana Jones. newlinechar  newlinechar But a cock is fine too.	Yeah, I should have included some indi shots. It was mainly due to Harrison Ford being insanely sexy that got me excited. 
&gt; A first class letter represents the LAST and ONLY means of private communication between US Citizens. newlinechar  newlinechar Nuh uh newlinechar  newlinechar [Don't worry, the U.S. government is tracking your snail mail, too](http://www.zdnet.com/dont-worry-the-u-s-government-is-tracking-your-snail-mail-too-7000017648/) newlinechar 	They cannot open and read it without a warrant. newlinechar  newlinechar A guy can cling to some hope for our Republic can't he? newlinechar  newlinechar Sigh.
The spite is generally towards how terribly he makes his points	I agree his points need improving, and if he's teaching these systems as simple conventions/theories, he needs to specify so from an unbiased view, whilst making it clear that a film-maker doesn't necessarily have to obey the method. Perhaps if there were a group of film-makers who could form somewhat of a discussion - using their knowledge as fuel to make more accurate posts?

It pisses me off that they rarely show the band on TV. It's more exciting than any half time show on TV (Except maybe TNTs basketball halftime).	Wow they don't!?

Granted.

It has a punchline that makes sense	Maybe I'm just dense and didn't notice it... :/ I know the original joke has the second scientist ordering 'water' and the first one gets pissed off because he wanted to kill the second one. I was expecting that punch line, so it seemed ironic when it was intentionally left out. But if the existing state of this joke *has* a punch line, then I concede it's not an anti-joke... I just don't *get* it.
that is correct	i thought that was the inbound pass that you roll on the floor for the pg to pick up whenever he wants
Agreed, it's really annoying when you're the tank and you're trying to pull aggro off of another party member but it makes you target the enemies on the other side of the screen...if there are existing ways to help alleviate that with the targeting filters, then could someone tell me how I should set it up? I tried messing around with it to no avail... newlinechar  newlinechar Even when you're not tanking, it's also annoying during FATEs since the high density of players and enemies in the area makes it difficult to target the enemies you need to hit before they die within a few seconds.	I've found myself running into the middle of the mass of players during FATES and just hitting FLASH. Not hoping to get the mobs attention, but in hopes it hits something. It gets me gold every time...but it comes with a shame I am not proud of.

2 Broken Rules outweigh 1. He has less than 150 karma &amp; only frequents giveaway subreddits. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm just clearing up this subreddit so it's for actual redditors.	No. This is one rule. There are two ways to satisfy this rule: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Your account is at least 30 days old. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. You have a minimum of 150 comment karma; not all the karma coming from giveaway subs. newlinechar  newlinechar Since this rule is 'and/or' you need to satisfy only one of the two criteria.

There's been a dev version up for more than a week and a half, maybe even two weeks.  No idea where you're pulling '3 days' from...	It was officially released a couple days ago.  As you say, that was strictly a beta.
For me S1 is absolute perfection. While S2 didn't live up to the first one, it was still good.  newlinechar  newlinechar The problem was that it was rushed, very much so. So, so much happens historically around the last five episodes, but they had to cram it in because HBO canceled it. Rome was supposed to have 7 seasons. I still mourn that loss.

Sorry I wasn't more clear. Of course I'm aware there's subcultures. I was actually a little surprised, and saddened too, that being teased for becoming educated is more common than I previously thought. I knew it existed here, where I'm from, because I experienced it firsthand,but I was never able to confirm that it happened elsewhere as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, this is something I noticed only occurred among the black children from the very low income areas. Kinda like the crabs in a bucket comparison. The black children from the middle to upper class were generally supportive of each other and studied together. An example of the different subcultures. newlinechar 	That's a socio-economic issue, not really subculture and this is usually experienced with all races from low-income areas. Secondly, you are only talking about 'children'. I guarantee you that adults are much different. Are you an adult? 
I found my problem. I knew of him, but never paid attention, so when I looked him up to see what he played, he's listed as a end on Wikipedia. 	As a Bears fan, *he's* the problem... 
Are rifts compatible with xbox360?	The consumer version hopefully will be compatible for all consoles. 
They vote based upon what the law stipulates, it's not made up on the spot but based upon legal principles. 	I don't think so. I've followed some General Assembly resolutions.

It's actually a bit of a joke.

How much does a years subscrition (or whatever the cheapest way to subscribe is in the long run) cost? And how much would it cost to buy the f1 car and the one from '79, '49, the Star Mazda and maybe a touring car with all the tracks I would need to compete in leagues/championships with these kind of cars? I can't really find any information on that, only the normal membership prices but I've heard people talk about much lower ones than those on their site. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, is it true that you have to pay to enter/host races?	1 year is $99 without discounts. They were running a promo for $50 recently. newlinechar  newlinechar The cars are $12 each. But you get a few to begin with as you do a few tracks. The tracks are $14 from memory. But you can't just jump in an F1 car you have to progress with the licenses and that takes time. It would probably take 6 months of game time before you would be realistic at getting an F1 car.  newlinechar  newlinechar I must admit, what I do is sometimes skip a week when its on a track I don't own.

Well since this is a pretty small community and I was the first (non-mod) poster, I guess I'll say hi too. I'm Alex, 16, from Los Angeles.

My dissertation topic pertains to Aspergers. My son is socially atypical, but the more I learn to see the world through his eyes, the harder time I have thinking of him as having a 'disability.' He was diagnosed Aspergers at one point, but as he matures and adapts, he no longer meets all of the criteria. But just like his sexual orientation, we accept him the way he is and things are just fine. The world would be a lot simpler if more people saw things the same as him. We neurotypicals make things a bit more complicated than they need to be, don't ya think? newlinechar  newlinechar Thank you for introducing yourself and I'm thrilled to have you as part of the community. =) Question: How do you keep the cat from eating the rats? 
Enchanted illusions should still do radiance burn, and the real PL did receive burn damage from the enchanted illusion in that game (you can even see in the screenshot the dire creepwave taking radiance damage). newlinechar  newlinechar It is still an illusion of brown's, and it was brown's actual radiance that killed puck.  But the enchanted illusion got kill credit, and it was on your team so it became a deny. newlinechar  newlinechar There might have been multiple bugs at play here, but at least one was that puck's radiance source was still attributed to the illusion on their team.	I didn't notice that enchanted illusions actually got the Radiance. In game they didn't last long enough to do any noticeable damage in teamfights and when I got the chance to grab one in a lull, the Radiance effect wasn't on the illusion and the icon was in its disabled state. newlinechar  newlinechar Still, it's weird that the deny was attributed to PL and not me. It's similar to doing fatal damage to an enemy with an enchanted jungle creep and neutrals getting credit for the kill. I supposed it's a little weird in the first place that you can enchant illusions, though. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, I'll check the forums and post it there if needed. newlinechar  newlinechar

That doesn't make sense. The two pieces in the middle are the same color and have different designs.

it was this [raid](http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/press.aspx?id=1299)... newlinechar  newlinechar umm... I don't know, I sold the rest of the weed, Paid my dude off. At first I had no idea how big it was. I just thought it was me and my roommates. The girl who's apartment I spent the night at (in her roommates empty bed) was actually the girlfriend of my coke dealer (Justin in the article). She heard from me at first, but it wasn't until day two of being on the lamb that we learned that he had been picked up for a controlled sale of a half ounce of coke to the same informant that busted me. Snitches name was Julia btw.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was more of a weed dealer, but I would do favors for friends, coke LSD Mushrooms etc. That snitch approached me and wanted an ounce coke. I knew I could do it. I texted my dude and I was like 'I want one' he thought I wanted a gram. And that is all I gave to Julia that night. It probably ended up saving me from a lot of trouble in retrospect.  newlinechar  newlinechar I had over a grand, but I couldn't go to my apartment, I couldn't go to my parents house. I couldn't go get my car. I honestly thought about getting a one way bus ticket. I wonder how differently my life would have turned out that day. newlinechar  newlinechar In the search of my apartment, they found a 20 Ga sawed off double barrel. It got pinned on me. I plead out to felony delivery of cocaine, misdemeanor possession of a prohibited offensive weapon. The sentence was 15 to 30 months. Did 3 in county, 8 up state, got let go early for good behavior.

So you lost control and that caused you to fall off? The only reason I ask is because one 35ft isnt that big if you are purposely jumping off of cliffs and two if you lost control when you were in the air then I don't see how skis would help you in falling.	I was an idiot and didn't scout the take off before jumping off because it wasn't that big of a drop. There was a dip right before the launch that kicked me forward and caused me to lose my balance and I wasn't able to recover before going airborn.

But people play the same amount in other games like DoTA, LoL, &amp; CoD...so I mean pick your poison.

If you find this interesting I recommend checking out his book *Supergods*. It's part history of comics, part analysis of their cultural and psychological resonance, and goes into detail on specific heroes like he does with Superman in this interview.	*Supergods* was really interesting and definitely helps you view comics in a different and important light.

To iterate, G2A lock-ons have worse tracking, following instead of leading the target, this results in longer overall flight time allowing for flares when they otherwise would recharge to late and more chances for scenery and ground to block the missile. newlinechar  newlinechar Also the G2G lock on has the same follow instead of lead tracking causing it to hit the ground when it comes to fast vehicles instead of hitting said vehicle and more often hitting cover instead of evading it.	The annihilator leads targets like the striker, but deals the least amount of damage of all HA rocket launchers (I'm fairly certain a stack-3 lancer is more damage, not to count that the cycle time is shorter) newlinechar  newlinechar Also sometimes, but with some difficulty at reproducing it, the G2G lock on will fire like a javelin missile, getting some altitude before striking from above (it still deals damage based on the direction you fired from though). newlinechar  newlinechar The G2A launcher has none of the special properties, the only redeeming quality is that you can dumbfire it.

I like to think that it did much more than that. Sure, we had the other esports from back in the day. BW, CS, Quake and all the others. With SC2, we made it global and we made it big. The reason LoL and Dota and even the FGC are really starting to blow up, is because of us. Despite not being the big kid on the playground anymore, we sure did pave some impressive roads.

Go on..	Ok. The guy in the photograph is not the guy who owns the robot it belongs and was fully built by another guy who works with us. From my understanding from talking to the creator a couple times. It's the most complex wall-e replica out there. He started with an r2d2 replica that ended up being used in that one Verizon commercial (would link but on mobile). He does all the work himself and can pretty much customize and action sequence into a script which is why the commercial and movie people come to him. I haven't sen either in person. I started after this was taken I'm pretty sure. 
US and Turkey are #2 and #3 respectively, so that doesn't *quite* explain it. The issue is 'they take approximately seven to ten years to reach significant production.'	That's how long it takes to start. Once they're up and going, 'Each pistachio tree averages around 50 kg of seeds, or around 50,000, every two years.'. There are plenty of other crops that take just as long to start up.

Quick copy-paste of the last time the Derpy mail-mare question came up: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The earliest mention I can find of Derpy (then also known as 'Bright Eyes') as a mailmare was in a [small fan-story by 'Manefag'](http://i.imgur.com/TZgFsbP.jpg) (verified by the [MLP General Archive](http://arch.413chan.net/co21205503.html#21206638)) in November 2010, three months before Feeling Pinkie Keen.

I like how when people start making black jokes and stereotypes about Lucian the mods feel the need to post guidelines on racism and hate speech, but when people make stereotypes about Koreans or, in this case, hate on gays, there is nothing.

Alex, you were already special to me for being the first poster on /r/outhere, but now even more so. My dissertation topic pertains to Aspergers. My son is socially atypical, but the more I learn to see the world through his eyes, the harder time I have thinking of him as having a 'disability.' He was diagnosed Aspergers at one point, but as he matures and adapts, he no longer meets all of the criteria. But just like his sexual orientation, we accept him the way he is and things are just fine. The world would be a lot simpler if more people saw things the same as him. We neurotypicals make things a bit more complicated than they need to be, don't ya think? newlinechar  newlinechar Thank you for introducing yourself and I'm thrilled to have you as part of the community. =) Question: How do you keep the cat from eating the rats? 	Aw, shucks, now I'm embarassed. If you have any questions about it feel free to PM me :). As for the cat/rats, we keep the rats in a cage whose openings are too small for them to slip out or the cat's paws to slip in, but it doesn't matter, since often I let them play together and the rats end up chasing the cat and nipping at his heels XD.

&gt; I'm a former Christian pastor who also studied for ~3 years for conversion to Orthodox Judaism before, eventually, becoming Hindu. With respect, I can assure you that the purpose of Judaism and Christianity is not to present an explanation on where the Universe came from. For example, a cursory reading of Genesis will demonstrate that barely any information is actually present, especially that information that can be tested newlinechar  newlinechar So, genesis does not tell the story of how god created the universe?  What was it about? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So what is the point of Judaism and Christianity? Well, you've heard it before from them but I'm going to go ahead and reiterate it anyway: love and respect. Kind of makes what's going on with, at least Christianity, a lot worse than just saying 'God made the Universe in six days,' doesn't it? =( newlinechar  newlinechar So why are there so many examples of barbarism in the bible?  Things that any sane person would consider completely immoral today? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So if the core commandment, the cornerstone upon which the entire religion is built, is love and respect then why is that the one thing they most need to work on? Well, I could write a book on that! =D Basically it sums up to human nature. It's easier for me to try to change you than it is to try to change me and, when I fail, it's easier to persecute you while claiming that you're actually trying to persecute me than anything else. After all, you're the one really at fault for all the world's ills, not me! (Not really, I like you a lot and I'm sure you're a great guy! =D ) newlinechar  newlinechar That's a laudable philosophy, my question is: why would a moral person require the threat of eternal damnation by an all-powerful creator to be moral?  Religion seems to be a way to scare people into the kind of moral behavior that atheists exhibit without any mythical threat. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So does this mean you need religion? If you think it'll help! Otherwise you know you better than anyone and I'm sure you're doing a great job at being the best you you can be! Keep up the good work! =D newlinechar  newlinechar So do you think that people should believe something simply because it will have a good outcome if they believe it?  I think you should only believe something if there is evidence that it is true, regardless of the consequences.	Namaskar! newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So, genesis does not tell the story of how god created the universe? What was it about? newlinechar  newlinechar Well, Genesis as a whole sets the stage for the history of the Jewish people. We're talking about the creation myth in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. Consider [this link's resources](http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#showrashi=true), especially R. Isaac's note under Genesis 1:1: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Said Rabbi Isaac: It was not necessary to begin the Torah except from âThis month is to you,â (Exod. 12:2) which is the first commandment that the Israelites were commanded, (for the main purpose of the Torah is its commandments, and although several commandments are found in Genesis, e.g., circumcision and the prohibition of eating the thigh sinew, they could have been included together with the other commandments). **Now for what reason did He commence with âIn the beginning?â** *Because of [the verse] âThe strength of His works He related to His people, to give them the inheritance of the nationsâ (Ps. 111:6). For if the nations of the world should say to Israel, âYou are robbers, for you conquered by force the lands of the seven nations [of Canaan],â they will reply, 'The entire earth belongs to the Holy One, blessed be He; He created it (this we learn from the story of the Creation) and gave it to whomever He deemed proper When He wished, He gave it to them, and when He wished, He took it away from them and gave it to us.* newlinechar  newlinechar The author(s) of Genesis didn't want anyone to be able to come along and place a better claim on anything the Jews had claimed or any action they were doing. The creation myth exists as a way of saying 'Our God created all this. If we're doing it it's because the One who created everything told us to.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So why are there so many examples of barbarism in the bible? Things that any sane person would consider completely immoral today? newlinechar  newlinechar This is a really indepth subject. I'm also a student of ancient civilizations and manuscripts. If you peruse some of my previous comments you'll see I recently discussed stoning in ancient Judaism. There I mention the cardinal rule when it comes to the study of ancient civilizations/manuscripts/languages/what-have-you: context. It's all about context. newlinechar  newlinechar Further, Christian Old Testament, Jewish Tanakh, presents examples of where man is not perfect and has to be continually returned to the grace of God. Consider the deuteronomistic pattern of redemption: God and Israel are in harmony, Israel upsets God (idolatry is a favorite), God punishes Israel (with an exile or captivity or drought, as examples), Israel realizes they messed up and asks God's forgiveness, God forgives them and they return to square one. newlinechar  newlinechar In other words: it presents a lesson that you *will* mess up, God *will* forgive you, you *will* mess up again. newlinechar  newlinechar There's a lot I could say on this subject but that's probably the most simple approach for now. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That's a laudable philosophy, my question is: why would a moral person require the threat of eternal damnation by an all-powerful creator to be moral? Religion seems to be a way to scare people into the kind of moral behavior that atheists exhibit without any mythical threat. newlinechar  newlinechar The threat of eternal damnation didn't exist until later under the rule of the Christian church and was brought forth from a perverted translation of the scriptures in order to control adherents. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So do you think that people should believe something simply because it will have a good outcome if they believe it? I think you should only believe something if there is evidence that it is true, regardless of the consequences. newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of people play the lottery because they believe it'll have a good outcome. =P newlinechar  newlinechar No, seriously, concerning Hinduism: *guna*. It means 'string' but in a more abstract sense it means 'division' or 'quality'. So what are *gunas* and why are they important? newlinechar  newlinechar This is going to be very concise as this is a long, difficult subject. Basically there are three *gunas*: *sattva*, creation or 'good', *rajas*, motion or 'passion', and *tamas*, destruction or 'indifference'. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the lessons we observe in the epics, as well as the *Vedas* is that there are two, primary types of worshipers (just in general!); those who worship in *sattva guna* and those who worship in *rajas guna*. Those in *sattva guna* worship God because they believe It is the Absolute Reality. Their worship consists almost entirely of compassion, adoration, love, obedience, and so on. These worshipers are rare and what most of us strive to be. Then there are those who worship in *rajas guna*, these are the worshipers who believe that if God exists then God can, somehow, be affected to provide them boons. Money, love, security, etc. their worship consists almost entirely of doing certain things at certain times in order to somehow convince God that they're worthy of this boon. Kind of like a kid with a messy room who *really* wants that new video game; oh he'll clean his room right now and act like things have changed, but once you hand him that game that's the last time you'll see that room cleaned until the sequel comes out. =P newlinechar  newlinechar So do I think people should only believe something because it will have a good outcome if they believe it? No. That's part of the reason I'm not out handing out religious tracks or trying to follow people around going 'Hey, hey you! Hey buddy! Heard the word of Shiva? If you don't listen to me you'll be bound up in *samsara* forever!'.

For clarification, what exactly happened? I wasn't there for it.	Fundamentally, it's irrelevant at this point. What matters is that there is an expectation of civil behavior that is the norm around here and every effort will be made to preserve it, up to and including the banning of users who deliberately seek to disrupt the community through inappropriate behavior. Having an  unpopular opinion is perfectly acceptable and no one should ever feel like they are unwelcome because they have an unpopular or different opinion. Even if your opinion is the commonly held one, if you can't state it and disagree with someone in a civil, polite, and courteous manner, all necessary actions will be taken to preserve the open, friendly, and welcoming environment this group has. We have a rare thing on the Internet and even rarer in Internet Heathenry, and I am immensely proud of this. It is wonderful to see that we have a place where people can come together, learn, share ideas, and connect with others in a frithful manner.

Reading your post makes me think you're a bit stuck up and prissy, maybe too much for your own good. YOU have baggage too, maybe not from dating but from life. You're wanting some great guy who is nice, charming and totally together.. But this is real life, those people don't exist. Everyone is messed up in some way and you find someone you fit with and can work together with, usually because love brought you close enough to find out if your broken bits fit together to make a more complete whole. newlinechar  newlinechar  	I don't think OP is stuck up and prissy.  She's just idealistic and hopeful which isn't a bad thing.   newlinechar However, I do like what you said at the end which I found oddly beautiful.  You're right, everyone is messed up in some way or another.  I especially loved the last part 'love brought you close enough to find out if your broken bits ft together to make a more complete whole.'  that's an awesome line.

With the likes of Nancy Pelosi in favor of military intervention, chances are slim that they are going to turn Obama down. Also, he knows that he could launch an attack without them, as per Libya. He wouldn't be asking unless he was quite certain that they would say yes. 	To be fair, that's broadly what David Cameron assumed in the UK and, it turned out that enough public pressure and discussion about the legitimacy of any military action (never mind whether it would remotely do what its supposed to, be appropriate, or indeed whether there aren't several other options that should be taken first..) ensured that a lot of MP's voted against a motion - less than one might have hoped, certainly less than what you might expect from public opinion (although that's not entirely a bad thing..) - but enough to stop it dead. newlinechar  newlinechar That's the first time that has happened in the UK for rather a long time.. 1782 in fact..

Not quite, a PU is more like having a King vassal in CK2 because they can rebel against you.	neither of those is correct, the shift in the effect of PUs from instantly having power in the new territory to EU's intergration mechanics is a good way to demonstrate the over arching goal in ck and eu being different games.  ck is about when landed families were the all important power sources, who used land to control power.  and eu is about how the land, the state is the power and the people just reside in it.  the difference in how PUs work is a good metaphor for the evolution of states in general.

Yeah, I only knew Socrates through Plato's writing previously. This is great! newlinechar  newlinechar I will note that the close of that chapter is somewhat terpy: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; âBut, by Jupiter,â exclaimed Socrates, âI do not wish that I should be drawn to you, but that you should come to me.â âI will come then,â said she, âonly take care to let me in,â âI will let you in,â replied he, âif another more acceptable than you be not within.â newlinechar  newlinechar Kinda badass, that. I haven't 'seen' Socrates with women much. He seems to prefer the company of bright young men in most cases, heh.	Yeah, Socrates is as much of a sexist douche as the rest of the Greeks. Part of that dialogue's humor is that Socrates is doing to Theodota what he's teachig her to do to other people. It's actually kinda Athenian Game, lol

thank you , i have a big old pool i have been contemplating using for a catfish pond however still working on cheap heating ideas lol newlinechar  newlinechar how many gallons is a 18 foot circle at 4 feet ?lol that outta hold a couple	If by 18 feet you mean diameter then the volume is ((18/2)^2) *Pi*4 = 1017.88 cubic feet which equals 7614.271 gallons. newlinechar  newlinechar If by 18 feet you mean circumference then the radius is 18/(2*Pi) = 2.87 feet.

You come from a different country, and thus a different value system. In Canada criminal matters are under the jurisdiction of the federal government exclusively. There is one federal Criminal Code, it is widely understood and respected, and there is no lack of avenues by the average citizen to participate in its amendment. So in this sense, this aspect of the 'government' is synonymous with the public and the average citizen. And no hazard applies to letting 'the government' determine your morals.  newlinechar  newlinechar In any case, your original argument was flawed anyway. You confused respect for the law and respect for the concept of equality before the law as synonymous with letting all aspects of government determine one's morality. Faulty reasoning.	I didn't confuse anything.  I just happen to believe that equality doesn't mean treating everybody equally shitty.
Manhattan and the 5 boroughs contain something like 12 million people - That would take something like 2 weeks to evacuate even if you knew something was coming. From Ready go, to Done. Not to mention the logistics of setting up an evacuation of 12 million beforehand. 	That's if you're *only* evacuating people by boat and with *only* the resources those people had. I'm pretty sure a government sponsored evac would have many more resources and use planes/helicopers/clear the roads for large buses as well.

Apparently it is caused by putting a goto in a loop.  It's an error on the calculators part, not on the codes. newlinechar  newlinechar but that's all I could find.	Well I'm getting down voted for some reason. But yes, if you put a goto in anything that expects an 'end' statement, its going to cause a memory loop because it'll keep opening more and more loops without reaching an end statement. So you have a bunch of loops that aren't getting terminated. This is an error in the code, as you have to respect the limitations and find a way around it.

Great advice. I suck at support so I wouldn't be doing that anyway =P. I definitely prefer the solo lanes and I was lucky enough to get either top or mid every time in my placement matches. Not sure if I'll be able to continue that trend but my next move is going to be playing mostly normals for awhile just to get better at the game before I jump back into ranked.	Yeah thats a smart idea but honestly I think this is the perfect time to play ranked. Its the end of the season, the games you play wont matter for like 3-4 months unless you're gold + since you will be getting victorious skin and all that. Also you will learn to adapt to ranked for the next season, like I said play it like its normal, even if you think u don't belong to your elo, just play. You will get way better, you will play with mroe expirianced players since alot of them played normals like you think about it, but when you think about it, its an epic time to start playing ranked, and you will start from playing rankeds, you will adapt to rankeds style, I mean like warding and all those things that alot of people tempt to do in rankeds but not in normals. I would really highly recommend for you just to start playing ranked as if  they were normal games, you have nothing to lose.

'Pssshhhhht'...? newlinechar  newlinechar Nah, back in the day (and still today by dinosaurs and the non-lazy), it was called 'soda pop.'  Since most of us are lazy, we shortened the name to 'pop,' while certain deviants took the opposite half.  I assume the 'pop' came from the fizzy bubbles when the beverage is first poured as it was coined in 1861, ~40 years before it was ever bottled.

He's not immortal, he just can't die via age/disease. Chop his head off and he's still gonna die.	Suppose I should have clarified. Normally when I hear the word immortal it's taken to mean 'doesn't die of old age, but can be killed.' This is opposed to the word invincible which would imply that he can't die period. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually looking at the definition of immortal, it seems to have a more specific meaning than the general one people tend to throw around a lot. newlinechar  newlinechar I just meant that the Nerevarine might not fit the OP's criteria since he's immortal in the sense that he can't die of age or disease. newlinechar

I wanted bullet points :(	I tried to interpret it more concisely, but I warn you it may miss some of the points he tried to make. Put on its own, the flaws in this advice really stand out: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; One: Don't lay groundwork, cut straight to the meat of the story. newlinechar  newlinechar Flaw: Starting a story in medias res ('In the middle of things') is a bold, difficult move. And even then you'll have to retroactively set up the background and setting. You can't just have your book occur in a stasis, locked off from the rest of the world it's supposed to occupy. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Two: Don't give 'background action' the same importance as 'foreground action' (Don't let your protagonists get overshadowed by your setting description). newlinechar  newlinechar This is actually decent advice, some writers get completely carried away with their flowery descriptions (One of the criticisms people have of Tolkien and George RR Martin, in fact, a major problem with a lot of fantasy books) and it makes the action in the book take a back seat. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Three: Telling instead of showing brings the atmosphere of the book to life with more ease. newlinechar  newlinechar Flaw: From my point of view, this is simply incorrect. I'll get far more immersed in a book if it goes into a nice bit of detail about what's happening rather than giving me a flat 'This happened. That happened. He looked like this, then she looked like that.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Four: Telling is more evocative than showing, it helps create a more well-defined 'picture' in the reader's head of what's happening. newlinechar  newlinechar Flaw: This is correct, but a bit divisive. I'm not on my own here, but I'm aware people feel differently. I will always prefer a book that lets me build my own image of what something looks like. I don't like to be told about every little item in a particular scene, I like letting my imagination do a bit of legwork. If an author actually follows through with this, it can fall completely flat. Especially if it's a detailed picture s/he's building. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Five: Extraneous details must be dispensed with in order to show off your story's point. newlinechar  newlinechar Flaw: It's hard to have a good story without a rich, interesting setting to base it around. To get a rich, interesting setting, you're probably going to have to throw off a few (otherwise superfluous) details on it now and then. Not so much your writing appears obsessed with it, but not so little that the story seems to forget about it. Stories happen in living, breathing worlds and they should reflect that. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Final note: 'Don't worry about 'Show, don't tell'. It is only good advice when you are skilled enough not to need it anymore.' newlinechar  newlinechar Flaw: This seems to imply that there's some invisible skill-based threshold at which solid advice suddenly applies. All good writing advice applies all the time. Depending on the genre you're working on, you may not need to follow all of it, but at least keep it all in mind as you write. newlinechar  newlinechar Quick-edit: Formatting.

I think the NAP sufficiently describes this as theft.  newlinechar  newlinechar Might I steal in an emergency? Yeah, probably - as a last resort. On the other hand I would expect retaliation, I would not try to redefine it as 'not theft' (as people there were) - once I get out of those circumstances you can bet the farm that I would make restitution. newlinechar  newlinechar As for people thinking libertarians are crazy, I don't really care what they think. The type of people who think it's permissible to just take what you want and pretend it's not theft form the basis of a society not worth living in. Just because I value life in general doesn't mean I have to value the lives of aggressors (or those who support aggression) as much as those who don't aggress. newlinechar  newlinechar As for someone shooting at the helicopter, that's obviously up to the individual, but I certainly don't think the thief is justified in shooting back - they're in the wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar People looting and stealing in an emergency has become a characteristic of uncivilized countries. Most of the time they're just taking stuff because no one's there to stop them and in the other remaining cases it can be chalked up to poor planning. newlinechar  newlinechar Fires are a regular occurrence. People can plan for those things; part of the plan should *never* be just taking what you want - that's the government's first and last resort. They use emergency power to justify just about everything and historically emergency power has taken more lives than it has saved. newlinechar  newlinechar In a libertarian society I would certainly have allowed people to use water on my property to put out a fire, but if someone wants to be 'crazy' with their property it is their right to do so.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't want to live in a society full of opportunistic thieves who the law actually *does* discourage; if that's the price for living in society then I don't really care if it burns down so the nightmare I am living in can come to an end. newlinechar 	There is plenty of room for discussion. Simplified down to the essentials the situation is: newlinechar  newlinechar  - There is some kind of an emergency. I need something you have, a tool or some other resource, to either prevent bodily injury, death, or a great loss/destruction of resources. You are either not there to give permission for use of that resource, it would take too long to ask for permission, or you outright refuse to give permission. newlinechar  - Do I have the right to use your resources under any of the above circumstances? Do you have the right to defend your resources in the same circumstances using up to an including deadly force? newlinechar  - Let's say I use $1 worth of your resources without permission to save a million dollars worth of damage to my own property. The numbers are about right for the case of helicopter using water from a pool to put out an expensive home that's on fire. If afterwards you seek damages for the $1 of water, how is it reasonable to award? After all, if the resources you took from me prevented a million dollars worth of damage to your property, it could be argued that those resources were really worth one million and you should be compensated by that amount. newlinechar  newlinechar I think society is interested in some leeway when it comes to cases such as this as it makes society as a whole wealthier. Almost without exception all of us would consider letting a man die of thirst by denying him water as completely immoral.

So I'd bet on it being a cavalry sabre.

I don't like the use of literally as an intensifier, but I consider that a matter of personal preference. I think it's more common in America, which may be why, and it's interesting that all of the authors you cite are American.  newlinechar  newlinechar What I find even more interesting about your comment is that you seem to begin by challenging the idea that there's any objectively better view about how a particular word should be used, then conclude by suggesting that it's clear there is an objectively better view, and that it's the one subscribed to by Mark Twain and your other luminaries rather than '16 year olds on reddit'. Doesn't the first part of your post require the belief that 16 year olds on reddit have a much, much better grasp of the English language than an author who died a hundred years ago?  newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps the usage of literally is in the process of changing, and becoming more restricted, because of those 16 year olds on reddit - and would that be a bad thing, in your view? 	I think you're seriously over analyzing what I said. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no objective way to use a word other than what society deems. Nothing more. The only absolutists are these people acting literally can have one definition and nothing more or that words have to mean precisely what they mean now and if those definitions change we are 'destroying' the english language. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason I gave off those names was to demonstrate the fact that it's not a new phenomenon of literally be used as an intensifier and it's by no means an amateur 'mistake'. Highly professional writers over the past 200 years have been using it as such.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only objective truth I'm arguing is that it is incredibly silly to say using one word rooted in emphasizing truthfulness as an intensifier is wrong but turning around using two more that are in the same exact camp ('very' and 'really') and not bat an eye. newlinechar  newlinechar There's European authors too who have used it as such. Bill Walsh, the writer of that WP article, has a podcast and he goes into detail about this and names off quite a few more than I listed in history. I was just giving some of my personal highlights.

How are fallacies not bad? I grant that there are some formal fallacies that are useful as heuristics, but that doesn't mean I'm justified in (for instance) responding to a quantum physics argument that has gone to the level of doing the math by asserting something about Stephen Hawking's beliefs on the matter. newlinechar  newlinechar I might use the number and type of fallacies a person is committing as a gauge of how much effort it would be to get the other person to a self-consistent argument that I could deal with; that judgment lets me decide whether it's worthwhile to continue the argument. So you committing a fallacy might reasonably cause me to leave the argument.	If you're interested in this sort of thing, I think you'd like the book I cited.

TheBorg had repeatedly accused my civ of cheating. Then his civ was actually caught duping and was wiped. I made a town where his capital was and called it 'Hypocrisy' to stick it to him.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was told that Ramseh banned me for harassing a moderator since TheBorg is a moderator. I see on the list here it says Strigon, a member of my Civ actually banned me. If that's the case then he has some explaining to do and some lies to clear up.  newlinechar  newlinechar But the fact that you would consider this walking the line of a bannable offense... That right there is why so many people want private servers and mod code released. It's the reason one of your former mods and 'beta elders' is trying to publicly stick it to you by releasing this log. It's the reason that you don't have enough people on line to fill one of your three servers on a Saturday.  newlinechar  newlinechar 	I dont know what exact incident you were previously banned for. But if that was the incident in question then it does in fact fall under a blurred line. Creating a proxy civ for the sole reason to harass another player is harrasment and its not the kind of competitive spirit that we'd like to foster. Make sure that you note that the ban was in fact reversed and your proxy harassment town was not disbanded by staff. newlinechar  newlinechar the game is competitive and we expect there to be some friendly jabbing here and there. But this kind of behavior does fall into a grey area. newlinechar  newlinechar Im sorry that you feel the game is being mismanaged. just know that we're always  working to make the community a better place to play. newlinechar

Two questions:  newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Is this change purely for cosmetic reasons or does the new flair provide any sort of practical advantage over the old look?  newlinechar  newlinechar 2) When I see a checkmark, I associate it with the concept of a correct or satisfactory answer like you'd see on a test, or in the case of ELI5, a post where the question has been explained well in the OP's opinion.  I do not see much of a relation between the same checkmark and a Modpost.  With this in mind, assuming it's doable, would it be possible to give the Modposts their own symbol, such as a capital M in a box? 	1) I think the cosmetics provide the practicality. It cleans the look up and makes it more noticeable if you're looking for it. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) We are trying to do this! It's tough because to our knowledge there is no non-hacky way of enabling flair that only mods can select at the moment.

Nothing can stop the tears of nitramlondon. From reading the rest of his posts on reddit I don't even know why he even plays the game anymore. 	Because the tears must flow.  They must flow to keep the darkness at bay.  The tears must flow so that we might never know the eternal torment that awaits us when the dark one is released from his prison, and these tears are the bars that hold him back, for the very weapon that *His Unholiness* wields to damn us all is the one that strikes him down.  Misery and suffering are the bars that bind him into his prison, and should these things ever vanish from our world, our world shall vanish, but it shall not be a slow process. newlinechar  newlinechar If, one day, far in the future, the darkness is ever gone in its totality from this world, if pain and suffering are abolished, then *He* shall arise to take his seat on a throne of torment that shall blot out the sun and consume the stars.  The moon will shine a bloody red the likes of which shall stir primordial fears, the fears of cave men sitting around campfires as they hear the sound of predators stalking them, the fear that soon the light will go out and darkness will take them.

That was a rough couple of years. I was pretty hot headed that whole time, so they couldn't really punish me. They grounded me, so I left town for a week during my senior year of high school.

Bitcoinpaperwallet.com newlinechar  newlinechar Extremely fast and painless. I've printed and distributed dozens. They make great presents, just remember to print a backup of each address incase people lose or destroy theirs due to incompetence.	Thanks. You da best.
We've been saying that for years. 	Ain't that the damn truth. 
the contradiction in your opinion isn't about whether a mov would fault on an invalid address but whether such addresses exist at all or not and if they do, do you accept that they're part of the particular runtime environment as it is trivial to set one up to have no faulting addresses whatsoever which would kill their construct (but you didn't raise this point - either you're ignorant of this possibility or you accept that the runtime environment is part of their construct, i was generously assuming it was the latter). newlinechar  newlinechar now if you accept that the runtime environment is fair game then you also have to accept that the same environment can be set up in a way that makes the final jump possible without an explicit jump insn. therefore their construct works fine with only mov insns. if you don't accept that the runtime environment is part of their construct then you cannot accept the existence of a faulting address either. which is it? ;)	What the paper is discussing is basically a hypothetical, restricted x86 processor in which the only instruction is `mov`, which behaves identically to the way it does on a regular processor.  Of course, `mov` does not exist in isolation and is connected to, for example, the memory subsystem in order to fetch values from, and store values to, addresses.  The behavior of the memory subsystem in turn behaves in accordance to the operating mode of the processor (i.e., whether paging is enabled).  A multitude of choices exists on how to restrict the processor in this hypothetical exercise.  We would have to fix individual configurations and argue about them specifically as to how we could affect the semantic behaviors that we desire for our exercise.  But in any case, we would have to make a very specific argument for Turing completeness by reduction onto the set of features that we have chosen.  You are arguing (or were arguing, before you got off into the weeds) that the x86 processor supports control transfers without requiring explicit instructions for such.  I was arguing that those features (as well as explicit control transfers) are separate from `mov`.  Beyond that, we could argue about specific combinations of configurations and their effects on this exercise all day.  Except I'm not going to do that, because it was a ridiculous paper to begin with, and the ensuing argument is doubly absurd, long-winded, and a waste of time.

Plus, the whole 'Geekdom' thing has become a lot less about imagination and whimsy and a lot more about pedantic memorization of fictional trivia and whatnot.

Damn, you really hit it on the head. Everybody is downvoting kizenco (the person I replied to) and upvoting me because they totally associate people who liked the new sequels as being childish and easily impressed because they were young. My comment had no condescension meant in it and yet people who misunderstood that are most likely the ones who have upvoted me. I couldn't agree with everything you've said more. Kizenco liked the sequels for the same reason audiences liked the first trilogy when it came out, they were breathtaking and imaginative. No wonder children liked them, they hadn't become cynical and jaded about fandom and what they've built up in their own minds to be what is best for this character or that plot point. I admit that the new sequels were nothing special (especially episode 2 which just felt like it would never end), but they don't deserve the hate they've received and the condescension towards people who admit to liking them is simply pathetic.

A 1960's corvette got a transfer of about 200,000 US dollars. Other than that there's not much to report. Over to you, Pete.	Still a better transfer saga than Bale...
I am just not sure why people think she was so 'caring' to her friends.  All she did was try to mess up their lives.  She was not a nice person, not at all.  All we see is a selfish little brat who uses people, and does everything for her own gain.  Nothing nice she ever said to the girls was real.  It was a 'I'll pull you up a little before I bitchslap you back down so hard your whole life is going to feel it.'  Thats my take on it anyways.  No one needs a friend like Ali.....	I mean, I can't really disagree with you, but I personally feel like that's 'old' Ali. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that one of the biggest subtexts in Pretty Little Liars is that people can grow up, forgive, and forget. Most of Ali's (and by association, the Liars') tormentees have forgiven her and them. If we are to take the things that happened to Ali at face value, then there's no doubt that her 'death' probably changed her for the better. newlinechar  newlinechar If there's still an element of the younger Ali in the current Red Coat Ali, it's simply the mysterious aspect to her: rather than directly helping the girls (by telling them who Big A is), she just saves them when they most need saving. newlinechar  newlinechar But, rather than this lack of useful aid being a form of cruelty or a 'game,' it could be Ali learning from her own mistakes with the girls: as far as I can tell, the Liars would have stayed 'kids' and been Ali's lackeys forever if she hadn't have died. But she did, and from that point on, the girls dramatically and exponentially grew up -- to the point where, if Ali truly needed allies, the girls would actually be useful.
It's also worth pointing out, though, that /r/atheism is a huge subreddit compared to /r/conspiracy so the percentage of the /r/conspiracy users who viewed /r/nslur is probably much higher than the percentage or /r/atheism users who did the same	Right, that's the point I'm trying to get at, that the first list is fairly meaningless. (Some measures of) similarity actually are what you're talking about, a percentage based overlap. The second table has that

If you look at brooksbaseball.net that's not an unusual strike for a left handed hitter.  Murphy just can't hit it and can't make the adjustment.	He shouldn't have to adjust to strike calls several inches off the plate. It shouldn't be called that way in any scenario. Umpires need more accountability for their zones, they shouldn't have such a profound effect on a batter's approach, and games in general, because they aren't consistent with calling strikes according the zone set forth by rules.

They scored again?!	Yep. USF is coming back though! ^not ^^really ^^^though. 
I just mean some type of storm energy metric.  The research radars show the El-Reno tornado to have wind speeds high enough for EF-5, but because it mostly hit fields and uninhabited areas it's now an EF-3 because there wasn't enough damage??? newlinechar  newlinechar politicians rate them based on damage, newlinechar scientists rate them based on energy.	I absolutely agree with this. For example, just because a strong solar flare is not aimed at Earth does not mean that it gets a weaker rating. Just because a hurricane spends its entire lifecycle at sea without hitting land does not mean it gets a lower rating. Why in the world should tornadoes be any different?
you got any source on your claim that sc2 is massively popular in korea?

Blizzard is really showing that THEY figured out how to do it right! newlinechar  newlinechar or even better newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; That's cool and all but we've got a LOOONG way before Valve reaches Blizzard levels. newlinechar But this is a good start...if the pie gets bigger it gets bigger for everyone! newlinechar

Then when the AI takes a physical form, the acronym should evolve into V.I.S.I.O.N., with the first three letters standing for the same words as the last three letters of its previous name. Any ideas for the acronym?	Very Intelligent System Integrated Over Neuronet? newlinechar  newlinechar Very Intelligent System Intoxicated On Narcotics? newlinechar

What do you do to meet people? How old are you? Do you live in a city? Curious because I'm living at home while I look for something to do with my degree, and I tend to get in a funk if I don't have people to hang out with for a while. Once I do land that First Big Job though, meeting people (eventually(?) among them potential SO's) is top priority.	Bars/parties/through friends/concerts/diners and on rarer occasions at diners or coffee shops.  I live in a city mostly republican and urban sprawl everywhere, but downtown there is a younger scene.  I spend most of my time in the 3 mile east side down town area, where I live and work.  I turn 27 soon.
Good luck! I had to restart mine on the 15th. Here's hoping it will work out well for both of us!	Can I ask why you had to restart?

I ended up getting the grey bezel one. I did take special note of your comment and tried on the 42mm watch again, and it was fine, but the 45mm just appealed to me more. I am grateful you mentioned this though since it's a big purchase and I would've regretted not carefully considering all my options.	Congratulations! and thanks for the follow-up.  The PO is so well executed that you can't go wrong with any of the variants (except maybe the one with the orange rubber strap).  
I read that as long as a male eats between 1500 - 1800 calories a day, he can avoid starvation mode no matter how high is calorie deficit is. 	You have read some very bad sources, then. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) 'Starvation mode' as popularly conceptualized doesn't exist. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Everybody's caloric needs depend on their age, weight, height, activity level, etc. Go look up a calculator. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) You're 145 pounds. Unless you're 5'2, you need to eat more. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, you need help for your depression. You also need to eat more.
&gt; After rooting for her and Matthew for so long, through so many obstacles, they finally made it, and they were so completely perfect for each other. newlinechar  newlinechar You know I was happy when Lavinia died? It's so morbid hearing it out loud but I was actually overjoyed that she died because then I *knew* Mary/Matthew would [hopefully] get together.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think Julian Fellowes had so many ideas for how their relationship would play out over the next few seasons and seeing them raise their son but... that didn't happen :(	Yeah, I didn't really care what it took to get Lavinia out of the picture. I didn't even mind that her death took a weirdly hurried, forced turn. It's really too bad that Dan Stevens couldn't have stayed on just one more season so that we could have gotten a little happiness. At this point Edith is going to end up having the best life, which is the opposite of what I had been expecting for the first 2.5 seasons.
This may not be the most obvious answer (and you have some excellent theories, all of which I'm sure play a part) but I believe the following gives the most insight into your question.  newlinechar  newlinechar /r/progmetal actually existed for a good while as one of the smallest metal subreddits. Our mods did a *ton* of networking and putting our name out there. It was a pretty large struggle before we reached the point that subscribers just started to amass on their own. The problem with subreddit startups in general is that the creators/mods don't do too much to establish their name. This involves plugging the name wherever possible (and relevant) and x-posting to larger subs, etc. I did stupid amounts of this daily and I'm sure some of the other mods did also.  newlinechar  newlinechar So I think this is what sets us apart subscribers wise. I really don't think prog metal is by any means the most popular metal subgenre (though with the recent djent and 'progcore' stuff somehow falling under the label, this is changing). It doesn't make sense that we'd have more subscribers than /r/deathmetal or /r/thrashmetal, or /r/PowerMetal, but again. Our early networking probably surpassed that of any of those subreddits. 	The concept of flair helps too, it's the little details that make a sub user-friendly. I'm sure a lot of new users that may not like harsh vocals find it useful. And I still use them if I wanna listen to instrumentals, or specific vocal styles.          
Doesn't matter what our domestic issues are.  Part of the job of a superpower is to use our power when force is needed.  The UN and other organizations (including NATO) are more for making peace in areas.  Superpowers, on the other hand, have a responsibility to help countries or people in need of a helping hand.  Disagree or not, I think we HAVE to intervene. newlinechar Edit: spelling	We aren't the only super power in the world. Let someone else deal with this shit for once.

Hey, nicely done!  You're doing your part to keep your neighborhood from turning into a ghetto (eventually) by actually owning and (hopefully) using unoccupied land.

If you guys can't think of a more eloquent and insightful way to express those legitimate thoughts, I don't feel too good about the future of your movement. 	I'm sorry I didn't dress it up for you.

Wow! Someone actually bought the Vita version!	On release day, call it wishful thinking if you will.
I wouldn't necessarily say I enjoy it, but I do sometimes specifically decide to have a sad day or moment. It sort of relieves me and let's me face things that bother me. I think that allowing myself to be sad about things in my life actually helps my body heal as well as my brain.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I had a miscarriage about 6 months ago and wanted to try for a new baby, but my period wasn't coming. I was extremely depressed about the miscarriage but I wasn't letting myself mourn properly, because I didn't want to upset my 1 and a half year old son. Finally, a few days ago, I asked my husband to sit with him for a while and I took a really long bath and just sobbed and sobbed and tried to get real closure. Today I finally got my period. 	I'm glad you were able to share that with us, I really do hope it wasn't too hard for you. newlinechar  newlinechar You're absolutely right about that sense of relief it brings afterwards. I think that's why I enjoy having those sad moments you were talking about- because afterwards, everything just sort of clicks for a little while.  I'm generally a pretty laid-back kind of person, but every once in a while I need that respite to help me put things in perspective.
Have you [upgraded to version 4.3.0.4](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-enhancement-suite/) yet? newlinechar  newlinechar But before you do that, you should [back up your settings](http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/wiki/backing_up_res_settings)!	Thanks for the advice :)

so no lippie? you have a really pretty natural lip color then. 	Unfortunately not, but thank you, I was told it was bad to wear it whilst my lip is healing as it can disrupt the process? I don't know how much of it is true, but I didn't want to chance it :p I think I may have to treat myself to a new lippie when it's healed :D
yup	Looking forward to it then :)
I missed the game. From what I have seen, we looked good? Or is box score misleading?	We looked okay.

You say you drink a lot of water - but work out in the morning.  Do you drink some right before starting cardio?  Phinney/Volek recommend drinking 16 oz 5-10 minutes before starting cardio - so that your body doesn't have enough time to start removing it from your blood.  I add electrolytes to mine, too.  As Darthluiggi said, electrolytes are super important.  The point of timing the water is that your body is happy with however much is in your blood stream if you are well hydrated - drinking the 16 oz right before cardio starts doesn't give your kidneys time to start removing it.  Then when you start working out, and your blood goes into all your muscles, you have more blood volume to maintain blood pressure.

I like to think by putting myself in my parents shoes, if I had a child and found their fetish (and it wasn't harmful), I would accept that this is part of their sexuality. I would not confront them about it and just shrug it off (as long as it wasn't affecting their normal lives), I am sure a lot of people have their own unique kink and a growing adult will always be caught doing something strange (american pie for example) where the father says 'we will just tell your mother we ate it all'. This is a way to accept and allow you to have your privacy. I think spying is natural for a parent to do (they want to make sure your not killing puppies or something that might need serious help). On that note I can also see why some parents may seek therapy when finding this fetish, to ensure nothing serious is wrong, I don't think they are so concerned about the fetish, as much as you being a well rounded individual and not letting the fetish rule you. 	That, in my opinion is the best way to do things, the problem is a lot of parents are either idiotic, yet, because they're the parent, think they're smart. or ignorant to foreign fetishes, lifestyles, or other decisions like that. and finding this kind of thing, they sometimes immediately assume that a man/woman who wants to wear diapers is a pedophile, because diaper=baby or something. and that's a shame. 
Maybe. Alot of samurai conflict happened before cameras. Samurai did exist whist cameras were around but by then they were more peaceful, but still possible. 	well either way.thank you for sharing I love the Japanese culture and this.us.just amazing.to me
&gt; So I guess RT ran with the story and kept it up to paint the Syrian rebels in a bad light? newlinechar  newlinechar You shouldn't be surprised. RT is absolutely awful. Literally Putin's mouthpiece. People were all huffy when it was banned from /r/news but I am glad to see it gone.	Meh, I wouldn't ban them from /r/news for painting a different picture that's not always true (after all, Fox still isn't banned either) - they often do very critical, yet truthful, stories about American politics. newlinechar  newlinechar But if they were really vote rigging, then I see why they were banned and agree.
We've been together 4 years total.  newlinechar I've told him flat out that sometimes I just want to hop on a plane and go back to my hometown. Do you think he doesn't take that seriously? What's a better way to word my feelings? newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think our insurance covers marriage counseling 	I didnt take it seriously. So no, he probably doesnt. He's probably just completely wrapped himself up in a cocoon as a survival mechanism, it's not personal, and it's not you, he's just dealing with stress in a very different way than you are. newlinechar  newlinechar Sit him down and tell him that the two of you need to talk about your needs. You need some sexual gratification, and you need some peace and quiet, among other things. He has needs too. Then, together you make a plan to meet those needs. newlinechar  newlinechar If I had it to do over again, marriage counseling is something I'd go into debt for. 
'If your friends were jumping off of a bridge then would you jump with them?'	Probably.

&gt;Rape until you say 'I want to have sex with you.' newlinechar  newlinechar Do you mean in her situation where she was passed out or in general?	In general. He sounds like a pusher - the type of guy that will keep trying and pushing her comfort zone and then deny he was going for it or even blame her. Also, if she's passed out and he's a nut case I wouldn't be surprised if she was out cold and he just went for it. Guess we'll never know though. newlinechar Edit: Sorry I mean in particular in this situation derp. Although, a 'can i grab a condom?' or something that states intentions and allows one to say no never hurts.

Very important to make sure patients understand how to gauge their pain properly, not just to ask them '1-10?' right off the bat. Does anyone have any good ways to explain to a patient how to gauge it, as in a way where I don't coerce them into giving me something I 'want to hear'.	I believe analgesia should be about correcting levels of impairment, and as such ask about *levels of impairment* the pain brings.

&gt; They leveled cities newlinechar  newlinechar Nonsense. A lot of mongol stories are made up bullshit. But even if they leveled a few cities, the great majority of the citizens would have lived.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; destroyed, probably, every farm they came across newlinechar  newlinechar So you are just making shit up now. If that was true, everyone in mongol controlled territory would be dead. The truth is that population across mongol controlled territory skyrocketed during pax mongolica. They increased so much that parts of the empire were able to break free - russia, china, ottomans, etc... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No food leads to famine. newlinechar  newlinechar The percentage of farms that the mongols destroyed is a lot closer to 0% than 100%. So whatever famine you are referring had nothing to do with the mongols. Famines usually occur due to WEATHER and/or poor farming practices ( ie not rotating crops ). 	I agree mostly with what you're saying, but you're point about pax mongolica (although completely accurate) is off point. It would be like saying the U.S. experienced no casualties because the baby boomers more than made up for whoever was lost. 
I'd rather have chance give me some options in my destiny than be placed in society from the get-go. I'd rather have some choice and have many different options and discover for myself what fits rather than be told from birth, 'you are designed for this. This is what you must do.' As it is, I have quite a few skills that I can choose how to apply and develop.	The design humans for something in particular is just one possible end of the genetic engineering thing. How about you have all the skills and can choose out of them, that are quiet some options. Engineering doesn't necessarily kill your options.

It still seems to me that every one of your complaints addresses white men only. Even the points addressing people who aren't white men seem to focus on a thinly defined masculinity that in many ways has little room for anybody but cis, white guys with moderate wealth. To get a better sense of where your coming from, is your cultural context for the present moment that white men are the predominantly oppressed group, to the point that worry about other people (or perhaps that all problems are solved by solving white men's problems). newlinechar  newlinechar In general, do you deny that specific experiences matter? I ask that since it seems you focus on white men's problems and you argue that unequal representation isn't a problem. It seems that specificity can't possibly matter or else it would be inaccurate to say that white men can represent non white men equally or more accurately than they can represent themselves (because, if someone has missed out on varied experiences of other people, then even when told about those experiences, they inherently would  not feel the same level of dedication/importance to those issue). newlinechar  newlinechar Also, are you more focused on culpability and legality than results. I am particularly curious about your thoughts on legality, since in many ways, legal change has not created equalizing results. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm not entirely sure what you mean here. newlinechar  newlinechar I am referring to the fact that there are a vast number of inequalities and oppressions that have landed upon non-white men. In response, there are a number of movements that seek the righting of these problems. Unless you are denying that inequality favoring white men has ever existed, your seeming position (focusing on white men as the primary sufferers of inequality) requires a massive historical shift of power scales tipping. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;the examination of the causes for them is suspect. newlinechar  newlinechar By which you mean, it is in opposition to your own. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Define power. newlinechar  newlinechar The ability to make decisions with situationally defined, broad effect. Nobody has individual power over culture, but it is everyone's responsibility. However, white men are vastly overrepresented in decision making positions. This is itself power as is access to the inroads to this power (cultural/social/economic). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They're not assumptions, they're deductions. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, then they've been deductions upon which you have leaned heavily enough upon that you have to be assuming them to be true before I have spoken on my stance on the subject yet.	&gt; It still seems to me that every one of your complaints addresses white men only newlinechar  newlinechar Ah no many of them affect black men even more. I was merely pointing to examples where white men are also disadvantaged. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Even the points addressing people who aren't white men seem to focus on a thinly defined masculinity that in many ways has little room for anybody but cis, white guys with moderate wealth newlinechar  newlinechar I'm pretty sure the majority of the homeless and victims of violence do not fit that at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;To get a better sense of where your coming from, is your cultural context for the present moment that white men are the predominantly oppressed group, to the point that worry about other people (or perhaps that all problems are solved by solving white men's problems). newlinechar  newlinechar No, it's that we shouldn't be ignoring people's problems just because a handful of them are doing better than others. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In general, do you deny that specific experiences matter? newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't they don't. I'm saying your conclusions from them are still subject to scrutiny. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I ask that since it seems you focus on white men's problems and you argue that unequal representation isn't a problem newlinechar  newlinechar Not inherently. It can be, but it would depend on how it came to be. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It seems that specificity can't possibly matter or else it would be inaccurate to say that white men can represent non white men equally or more accurately than they can represent themselves (because, if someone has missed out on varied experiences of other people, then even when told about those experiences, they inherently would not feel the same level of dedication/importance to those issue newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to think you speak for the motivations or actions of others based on your experience. You are making a barely coherent argument that is also hypocritical. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Also, are you more focused on culpability and legality than results. I am particularly curious about your thoughts on legality, since in many ways, legal change has not created equalizing results. newlinechar  newlinechar I am focused on responsibility. Perhaps you should demonstrate that it's inherently bad that unequal results occur. Maybe there are other factors that you're overlooking in thinking how equal results can or should occur. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I am referring to the fact that there are a vast number of inequalities and oppressions that have landed upon non-white men. newlinechar  newlinechar I never disputed this.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In response, there are a number of movements that seek the righting of these problems. Unless you are denying that inequality favoring white men has ever existed, your seeming position (focusing on white men as the primary sufferers of inequality) requires a massive historical shift of power scales tipping. newlinechar  newlinechar I never said they were the primary sufferers. I'm saying it's not as simple as you make it.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The ability to make decisions with situationally defined, broad effect. newlinechar  newlinechar So you're ignoring influence over those who make the decisions.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Nobody has individual power over culture, but it is everyone's responsibility newlinechar  newlinechar Including women.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;However, white men are vastly overrepresented in decision making positions. This is itself power as is access to the inroads to this power (cultural/social/economic). newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah let's ignore the Persian Empire, Umayyad Caliphate, Han Dynasty, Ottaman Empire, and the Mongols too.  newlinechar  newlinechar This goes back to the narrow definition of power. As the great logician Bertrand Russel once said, 'you can prove anything when you start with a false premise'. Nowhere did I say white men have it the worst; pointing out that white men have it bad too does not imply that at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar It seems you are still invoking a fallacy by focusing on the top of the heap and seeing who most of those there are while ignoring who most of the bottom of the heap, which is men.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I have kind of the same experience. I was sitting in the smoking room in a bar. My beer was empty and I was out of money for that night. I was sitting alone at a table where someone left an almost untouched bacardi coke. I was drunk so I decided to take it and drink the whole glass at once so if the owner of the drink returned he wouldn't be able to recognize his drink out of all the empty long drinks. I proceed to drink the bacardi coke and when I'm almost at the bottom I taste this burned, tobacco-like taste. Instantly I know that either I'm gonna have to swallow or spit as I see the beginning of what looks like a cigarette bud in the bottom of the glass. Turns out the reason the drink was so full, was because someone used it as an ashtray... I drunk the whole glass though..	Reminds me of 'Beer Roulette.'

&gt; The modern American accents seem to be closer to the colonial accent than the modern British accents do, which leads me to my final point, relating to how the regional American accents developed, as you asked: Why did the British accent change more than the American one? newlinechar  newlinechar Some Americans have gone through two extensive changes away from whatever colonial accent(s) existed: the [father-bother merger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%E2%80%93bother_merger#Father.E2.80.93bother_merger) and [the cot-caught merger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%E2%80%93bother_merger#Cot.E2.80.93caught_merger) so where some British speaker pronounce three different vowels in &lt;caught&gt;, &lt;cart&gt;, and &lt;cot&gt;, some Americans have the same vowel for all three words (disregarding rhoticity).	True. Speaking of rhoticity, that's a feature characteristic of the gradually encroached-upon historic southern English accents I mentioned.

Generally you want to start out your build with CDR, this allows you to push your lane early by spamming Q, you can do this safely with W up without boing at risk of taking too much harass.

Anyway, this is your core, Sorc Shoes/Morello's or Athenes/Deathcap/Void, the next 2 items are all down to preference and how the game is panning out. If the games going well, and you are not getting caught in teamfights and are allowed to unload your entire combo in teamfights, Ryali's+Liandries will turn you into a mobile ion cannon, you can use any of your damaging spells to slow the target, and make it much easier to land the rest of your combo, combining Ryali's with Liandries is natural as it doubles the DOT burn from Liandries and allows you to poke very effectively with your long range, short CD Q.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also the health these 2 items helps you deal with any long range damage the other team has. Other items can be picked in place of these two however, items such as GA (for a final end game teamfight), Zhonyas (VS AD Assasins or high single target burst such as Zed), take into account that you should build the Seekers Armguard first during lane if you face an AD Assassin, this combined with your passive makes you tough to burst. You CAN get yourself another CDR item (Morrelos or Athenes) if you are permanently engaged in a poke war, however I dont like to do this as masteries+blue buff+blue elixer should cap your CDR anyway. DFG is also a viable pick, but not reccomended unless you frequently find the opportunity to assassinate a target that dives you in fights, although if you are struggling with Xerath then you probably shouldn't try this as it is VERY situational.  newlinechar  newlinechar To expand on playing him early game, Poke and push. Spam Q, get either Chalice or Kages ASAP, and just farm early game, if you manage to land a stun, ensure you get a few auto attacks in-between Q's to maximize the amount of damage you deal. Harassing them early is extremely effective because they can't just sit under the tower and farm like in most matchups, because you can hit W, and keep hitting them under turret, forcing them to lose Exp and Gold, sometimes even netting you a kill as most players underestimate his range. If you do manage to outplay your opponent and force him under turret, WARD BOTH SIDES OF YOUR LANE! If the enemy jungler ganks you while you are in locus trying to poke in the middle of the lane, chances are you are dead if you can't land a stun or don't have flash. Mid-Late game, take advantage of your range to poke, and to help siege turrets and force the enemy team off of objectives (such as dragon/baron), in most cases, you will force them to disengage and back off.  newlinechar  newlinechar Learn your ranges while in locus, and try to figure out spots you can hide in the jungle during sieges (such as wolf camp when pushing 2nd tier mid tower) and poke from there, this will very frequently force people to group to the other side of the lane while defending/attacking, making them much more susceptible to your AOE. newlinechar  newlinechar I hope this is able to help you, if you have any other questions on Xerath feel free to ask! newlinechar  newlinechar Sources: I have been a Xerath main since the start of Season 2 newlinechar  newlinechar 	Also, don't worry about losing to a janna, If the player knows how to use AP janna, she is very difficult to beat in lane because she doesn't let you kill her and she clears the entire wave with a single Q

I was pretty disappointed in this game actually, but hear me out before downvoting me: The skill trees were stunted, and heavily in favor of a violent approach, there weren't enough weapons to facilitate a peaceful playthrough, the storyline was exceptionally short, and the ending was so abrupt and bland I honestly didn't realize it was over until the credits ran.	I don't particularly disagree with any of your points but I only find the short story part to be a negative.  Obviously more content would be nice, but it had enough for me to enjoy it.

However the initials 'NSA' appear to be. The NSA may be seen as a kind of 'trademark' for the NSA, [and that has less free speech protection](http://www.wptn.com/trademark_vol5is1/insight.htm) than traditional copyright (which is pretty bad in the first place).	Well it is absolutely not a trademark, but that aside, the REST of e clause that they pasted says '*in a way that implies the agency endorses it*'. newlinechar  newlinechar Roughly paraphrased of course - but the point is that you can't just print your own t-shirts with a seal that say 'NSA - fighting for freedom' or some sht like that, as if it was the NSA that supports or endorses the t-shirt. newlinechar  newlinechar However, the language of the law they cited seems to *go out of its way* to allow for parody works just such as this one. newlinechar  newlinechar The NSA clearly has no case here.

it's a cultural thing. a lot of the taboo on it seems to inherently stem from religions. which I've always thought a little peculiar, since the first time god got annoyed with adam and eve, was when they clothed themselves in  leaves to hide their nudity. the bible says they felt ashamed about it, because they aware of it after eating the apple of knowledge of good and evil. there is a school of thought that says the fruit represented sex, and god cast them out because adam and eve did have intercourse, while god had designed them 'in his image'. eg- not reproducing, just the two of them, tending to the earth and it's creatures.  newlinechar  newlinechar anyways. in some cultures they're more open to it than in others. the french seem to be quite open about it. it does seem that where religion has or historically has had a stronger footing, there's more opposition to any exposure or sexual references. especially regarding children. and again it seems rather contrary, because young children have usually recently been breastfed, yet seeing a nipple is deemed more inappropriate to them than adults shooting and stabbing eachother on tv. people are funny things.	I never thought about the fruit representing sex- thanks for mentioning it. However, it makes an interesting parable for the relationship between sex and death. If death did not exist, reproduction would not be necessary. Looking at the Adam and Eve story with this lens, they created death (sin) by having sex (apple). Maybe the dead person(s) that wrote the Adam and Eve story were just trying to understand reproductive immortality then religion happened and fucked it all up.
Wow. Three things: 1. Saving money is actually defined as a 'leakage' from the economy just like overseas bank accounts and exports. 2. If eveyone saved money the economy does the opposite of 'grow'. Demand i.e. Spending is what drives the economys growth. Weak demand results in things like the great depression. 3. This phenomenon is referred to as the 'paradox of thrift' - essentially the paradox is saving is good for you personally but bad at a macro level for the economy.  newlinechar  newlinechar The comment above would be hilariously misinformed if it wasnt this kind of economic misinformation that got us all into such deep shit. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I seriously want to know what school taught you those things in your economics courses?	I misstepped. Investment is more what I meant than saving, but saving more than we do is still in the right direction. Yes it is true that immediately you'll see less money being spent. However in time people saving money leads to less bankruptcy less foreclosure and less wage garnishment. People who don't know how to spend their money and spend it wildly end up spending their credit limit and then they end up going bankrupt that is not good for the economy at all. So the long term benefits of saving are far greater than spending.   newlinechar But really by saving, I mean turning it into loanable funds (sort of like equating it to an investment) where the bank is able to loan out the money they put in the bank rather than have it sit around and lose value. This not only helps stimulate lower interest rates but also increases *subsequent* investment and spending.   newlinechar So I really don't disagree about leakage and I'm not saying all spending is bad. It's just sort of better for us to increase the ability for businesses or people to take out loans they can pay for. (And the paradox of thrift assumes a closed economy which is true globally but not nationally where we have holdings elsewhere.) And Northwestern.

In fact every study that's looked at it has concluded that since cyclists are also homeowners or renters and ALSO OWN CARS so they pay the same taxes apart from gas as car drivers do, and cyclists cause vastly less damage to roads, that cyclists actually pay far MORE than their share of the costs of infrastructure. newlinechar  newlinechar You may live in an area where car drivers are particularly bad.  Around here there ARE no alternate roads, there ARE no side streets, there ARE no bike lanes.  At the edge of my property is 2 lane 50 MPH road with no shoulder.  Yet I have had no problems with car drivers in 30,000 miles. newlinechar  newlinechar I ride down the middle of the road only in a small part of my commute, where the road is in really bad shape and I have no choice (other than to either stop or get a flat tire on the potholes).  If there are cars behind me, they SLOW DOWN AND WAIT to safely pass, as the law requires.  I have not had any trouble with anyone not doing this.

Thanks for the response! i really appreciate your feedback. how'd you like ye TOBS grapefruit? That's the other one I wanted to try. I have hard water so I figured a cream would be better for me. Plus, I have a body butter that's grapefruit and it's the most amazing scent. 	The TOBS is definitely a quality cream. I'm almost through my tub. I'm from Las Vegas, so I used it because I also had hard water. It works very well, there's a reason why it's popular. I bought the Barrister and Mann now that I'm back at school in DC and have soft water. To be honest, I haven't found a cream/soap other than col conk with a bad lather (and that was because I didn't realize I had hard water). It's just a matter of slick vs cushion. TOBS is more slick to me. Barrister and Mann is more in between, but leaning towards cushion. As with anything, YMMV. newlinechar  newlinechar Leisureguy also talks about distilled water shaves for soaps if you have hard water. Perhaps give that a go?

Hunter gatherers worked maybe.... a couple days a week. It was when we invented agriculture that we started having to go at it all day every day. 	Agriculture has definitely sped things up.

The only reason we work so much these days is that our standards of living are much higher and require much more to maintain. 
Another poor sod who's the oldest in the year. Used to drive me *nuts*, and I know my parents tried to get me in the year above for many years as well. It just didn't seem right that someone born 3 days before me was leaving school a year earlier, and another of my major problems with secondary school was that for many privileges (like being able to leave the school at lunch and free periods or going home early on a wednesday when you had the two hour study period)  they went by year and not age so I spent an entire year being treated like a 15 year old and not a 16 year old which may seem a bit silly to me now but at 16 it was a big fucking deal.	As someone who got into the year above, I would have preferred I had been held back. Imagine being essentially a year younger than everyone else, both in age and maturity, but not being that old. And, of course, watching everyone else in your year getting to do things a year before you. Not fun.

Somebody got a little worked up..... Just so ya know, you can still have conversations with people even if you think they're a bitch.... I know she won't come back but I'd rather keep talking to her as an ex than have someone on here recognize her face and tell her about it and lose all of the mutual friends we have.......... And I know she would have broken up with me and fucked him in the summer if I didn't let her so at least I got good pictures and have her break up with me than have her break up with me and not get anything. 	No, you can't 'have conversations' with somebody like that. You don't have mutual friends. If you do, this whole schpeel is going to come out anyway. You're going to lose their respect as well for taking it like a bitch. You're making excuses for your bitch-assedness right now. You're still hoping she comes back. Even after all this shit you would still take her back. She has no respect for you. Even if he dumped her and she came back to you, it would just be until she finds a new dick. Its really pathetic. Don't post the video (like a real 'friend' would give a fuck after what she did), but do yourself a favor and realize you aren't 'on good terms', and you shouldn't take her back. Stop talking to her. Move on from this embarrassment and put this shit (and her) behind you for good. newlinechar  newlinechar P.S. - she was lying when she told you she didn't cum. Seriously.

Not true. The majority of obese people follow the simplistic instructions they've been given that are supposed to help them lose weight. The only thing that happens is they end up weight cycling which is actually the biggest predictor of weight gain. The calorie hypothesis contributes to obesity, and it doesn't do anything to curb it. It's part of the problem, not the solution.	I refuse to believe that the majority of obese people actually, strictly follow calorie restriction diets without losing any weight unless you show me some evidence of that.
The concrete stoop is not my favorite. The siding / trim fix that exposed this problem should take care of the water issue. newlinechar  newlinechar If the wood is damaged through-and-through, can I cut out the damaged section and replace it? I don't think it would be more than two or three feet of wood.	From what I am understanding from the pictures is that the damaged area you have circled is called a 'plate' The wide board above that is called a 'band board'. The plate lays on and is fastened to the concrete foundation. The band board appears to be a 2x10 and it will span at least 16' (as it would if there was a window below it). Unless the damage to the plate is more than 16' continuous  it will be fine. But to answer your question yes you can cut out the damage and replace it using pressure treated lumber. Also, I would use Azek (plastic wood available at Home Depot/Lowes) for the new trim.

Yeah I'm really surprised at the McNutt cut. I haven't seen anything of particular interest on waivers at WR (maybe Tavarres King or Gettis) though, they might be exploring trades at the position (unlikely for a #5) or they might be happy with Thigpen as the fifth guy. newlinechar  newlinechar Also I didn't expect Kheeston Randall getting cut. Thought he played well at DT, better than Vaughn Martin had anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar That's one crowded defensive backfield. Don Jones is a guy I'd expect to get waived soon to make space for another WR.	Last year we had 6, it's surprising one of the 3 didn't make it.  Pretty upsetting, I really thought McNutt would make it after Tyms and Bumphis were reported.
An AI making jokes about killing scientists with neurotoxin during a 'Bring your kid to work day' and how the main character is unwanted by her parents is far from as dark as WALL-E was. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is, Portal isn't something that could easily be made a movie out of, and releasing it by a company that only makes children-appropriate movies would be a disaster.  They would have to drop all the dark humor therefore losing the spirit of Portal.	Oh, I definitely don't think Portal would be well suited for a Pixar movie. I was just using Wall-E as an example of them being able to pull off a more 'real' feel.

&gt; cheap helmets protect just as well newlinechar  newlinechar This is the issue I have with OP's statement. newlinechar  newlinechar Quite simply, no they do not.  'Cheap' helmets (ie: plastic helmets) do not protect nearly as well as fiberglass or carbon fiber helmets.  The main reason is that the plastic, although cheap to produce, is much softer than the fiberglass.  Because of the softness of the shell, a manufacturer typically has to use a polystyrene that is much MUCH tougher on the inside of the shell in order to maintain a satisfactory level of safety.  This tougher polystyrene will not absorb a hard impact the same way a soft polystyrene will. newlinechar  newlinechar Cut an HJC and an Arai in half and let me know what you find...  Typically the Arai will have 5 layers of polystyrene that will be unseparated by glue whereas the HJC will have only 2 layers of MUCH harder polystyrene AND have glue strips holding the layers together (these glue strips also don't transfer energy as well as the polystyrene itself). newlinechar 	I guess it depends how much faith you put in DOT ratings and assessment. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure that extra protection might make a difference in a 200mph crash. But if it's good enough for the 70mph crash I'll have then do I need more? newlinechar  newlinechar I could go further and further looking for more and more protection, is the HJC the point that it's 'enough'? In OPs case, it seemd to be. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally the sacrifice I make is in buying more expensive flip front helments. I accept the risk of the front seperating because of the convenience of being able to lift it. I accept that the DOT ratings are 'enough'.

If you mean not all bees work in one chunk, isn't there a machine/tool that acclimatizes the bees to be able to work in any biome? I'm not really a bee expert, so I may be mislead.	The acclimatiser can get most bees to work in most biomes. However, the limitation is that you can only get both_4 for temperature. I guess as long as you live in a normal/normal  biome, any bee can technically grow, with the exception of biome-specific bees.

I have. I tried it for a few hours yesterday but I was making frequent typos and it wouldn't correct them. Am I doing it wrong? Should I be using it longer first?	When you start out, it will be like that. What you pat attention to is the three words at the top. The middle word is what it thinks you are going to say and the two others are alternates that it thinks it could be. When you first start working with it, if you are typing a word, if you see it pop up in any of those slots, click on it. You are basically teaching it which word it thought of correctly. Eventually, those words will start appearing in the center which means, if you just hit space, it will autocorrect with that word. Sounds like it would take a lot of work but it doesn't. Try to reward it if it guesses some hard or unique words.

Blacks only make up 13% of the US population and most of them are already mixed with at least 20% of something else.

As a fellow American I disagree. They play positionally quite well, they both are fast enough and strong enough. I don't see what the problem is. I definitely do agree that Gonzalez is better than Goodson, but I think that either, at this point, would help and not hinder the defence greatly. Mexes is getting old and it shows. Zapata is fine on the ground but when a ball is in the air it troubles him and Mexes both. I mean it isn't like either of these guys are actually going to be bought in the next two days anyways, but what I'm saying is we need someone like them.	I love our national team players just as much as the next guy but neither of guys are of the quality to play for Milan. You're right, physically they would pass the test but I disagree vehemently with you about their positional play as I feel that is the weakest area for both of them. Mentally and technically they just aren't good enough. Milan doesn't need players like them we need players head and shoulders above them because as it stands now our starting centerbacks aren't even good enough. But I don't think we will agree on this so no hard feelings.

I've tried to put a number of kids into the path of programming, its too freakin hard of a concept for them to learn enough to start getting reward from. newlinechar  newlinechar As a 12yr old I somehow KNEW I would be rewarded and stuck with it, OR I was too damned bored playing one of the 10 games I owned, for the 200th time. newlinechar  newlinechar When I give a kid a newly installed computer setup with linux and python/ipython/lua/perl/monodevelop and a couple of games that they can hack on, they NEVER continue past the initial instructional course I can give, and they quickly start playing flash games on facebook. newlinechar  newlinechar And from what I've have found or at least considered creating is that logic / programming games are not fun for kids, they are too involved, and the quick 'high' from gaining a facebook badge is more addictive and interesting ...1@#$%!@#$ &lt;/rant&gt; frustrating... really. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't say I've failed yet, since its one of those things, that maybe the casual introduction will eventually be rekindled later in life.	..or it takes a special person to want to program.

The tip is flared so that it doesn't come out of the jack, as /u/nalc said. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're curious, the reason that 3.5mm (headphone jack) is divided into 'segments' is so that it can provide stereo sound, whereas quarter inch (like a guitar cord) are mono. Stereo sound has two separate channels for left and right, which is why you'll hear one part of the song in one ear and another part in the other. newlinechar  newlinechar The tip of the jack carries the signal that will go to the left speaker/earbud/headphone, the middle segment carries the signal that goes right, and the bottom segment is ground, which completes the circuit. newlinechar  newlinechar You might have noticed that sound only comes out of one earbud if the jack isn't pushed all the way in, and that's why. Usually if you only put the jack in partway, only the left side can receive a signal (but it will confusingly be the signal intended for the right side!). newlinechar  newlinechar As for your second question, USB ports are usually pretty stable. Frankly, though, it shouldn't really be an issue unless the manufacturing quality is really poor.	There's plenty of quarter inch stereo used for pro audio or audiophile headphones (You'd probably be hard pressed to find over-the-ear headphones above $200 with a 3.5mm jack). Quarter inch balanced mono (it's a stereo plug but rather than being L - R - Ground, it's Positive Signal - Negative Signal - Ground) is fairly prevalent on some pro gear, although of course quarter inch mono is very prevalent, both on older pro speakers (prior to Speakon) and on guitars and similar instruments.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, 3.5mm mono exists as well, although it's rare to see it now (generally, the only time most people would see it would be if their computer speakers used a 3.5mm mono to connect the left speaker to the right speaker). There's also a 3.5mm that has three channels plus a ground, which is normally used for stereo audio and composite video, or for stereo audio plus a microphone for modern smartphone headsets. What's neat about that (and the whole connector philosophy) is that you can use a plug with less connectors in a jack with more, and it will still work. So if you've got a 3.5mm stereo plus microphone jack, you can plug in regular headphones without a mic and it will still work. newlinechar  newlinechar The proper way to refer to these contacts are as the Tip, Ring, and Sheath. The tip is fairly obvious, it's the first contact. The sheath is the last contact, because if it's a metal body connector, the last contact is connected to the body. Any intermediate connectors are designated ring. newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, a mono plug with one insulation band separating two conductors is called a 'TS' - Tip + Sheath. newlinechar  newlinechar A stereo or balanced mono plug with two insulation bands separating three conductors is called a 'TRS' - Tip + Ring + Sheath. newlinechar  newlinechar A stereo + video plug with three insulation bands separating four connectors is called a 'TRRS' - Tip + Ring + Ring + Sheath. newlinechar  newlinechar It's also worth noting that many older cell phone headsets (prior to modern phones that all use Bluetooth or 3.5mm TRRS) used a 2.5mm jack. I believe most of these were TRS, with mono audio and a microphone channel.

AP Physics B is actually a much better preparation for the SAT II in physics than either C Mech or E&amp;M would have been. If you passed AP Physics B you should be in good shape. newlinechar  newlinechar I would look over the [list of concepts on the test](http://sat.collegeboard.org/practice/sat-subject-test-preparation/physics) for an idea of what to expect.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you really wanted to you could consider getting a [review book](http://www.amazon.com/Barrons-SAT-Subject-Test-Physics/dp/0764143530); this isn't totally necessary considering you should be fresh on the material, but it won't hurt you to look at it if you can spare the cash. It will give you a more in-depth look at the concepts on the exam, as well as some practice problems that you can do. This isn't absolutely necessary, and you can find comparable resources online for free, but I've found that students enjoy having a physical review book in front of them.  newlinechar  newlinechar For what it's worth, I'd say getting a [math II review book](http://www.amazon.com/Barrons-Subject-Test-Level-Edition/dp/1438000316) would be more beneficial for someone in your position, since it seems you have the requisite physics knowledge. The physics SAT II is relatively straightforward; if you know your stuff you can do it. The math II exam is more tricky; the SAT math section's big brother. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Source: private AP/SAT tutor who predominantly tutors math and sciences. 	thank you very much!
I can assure you from the people I know who were in the cast that they are definitely not racist. Also the four years since 2009 are enough for almost all students from that period to have moved on	Given most law students do con-joints, the large majority of the first year law students from 2009 who gained admission will still be there in their fifth year, so they won't have moved on.  newlinechar  newlinechar And 2009 was four years ago, not sixty years ago. If racism was such a problem among first years in 2009 they actually had to shut down the departmental discussion boards for students, I don't see why the problem would magically fix itself in four years time, particularly when the student body that resulted in the discussion boards being taken down are now among the senior students of the faculty. The problem wasn't anything specific to do with the student intake in 2009, but rather the general institutionalized racism that exists among the New Zealand public that we like to ignore.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've personally experienced it, and heard about problems with racism in the department from students, tutors and even a lecturer. Obviously not all students hold racist feelings, but anyone who says there is not a significant amount of anti-Maori and Pacific Islander racism among Auckland Law students is either lying or willfully ignorant.  newlinechar

Some people think the EMS might be caused by an accidental ingredient (contaminant) in some 5-HTP products. But there is not enough scientific evidence to know if EMS is caused by 5-HTP, a contaminant, or some other factor. Until more is known, avoid taking 5-HTP.'

How are the mold lines on the kits? Do they stand out badly or are they well hidden?	They're not great, but nowhere near the worst I've seen. Gipsy is the worst out of the three, with seams running down both the front and back of his limbs and the back of his torso. Also not an amazing paint job on him.  newlinechar  newlinechar Crimson Typhoon is wei better (badum tiss) with the only visible seams being on the back of his calves and forearms. HOWEVER he has quite a bit of an issue with a loose leg and his third arm seems to like popping out. Real easy to fix though, just a ball and socket. newlinechar  newlinechar Knifehead only has one visible seam by his tail, other than the obvious joints anyway. He's real sturdy and doesn't afraid of anything. Only problem is his disproportionate size in comparison to the Jaegers.  newlinechar  newlinechar All in all: 3/5, would put on shelf and admire forever, would not give to violent child.

Have you never played WoW? For a long time that had millions of subscribers and players. It may not be a fad that dies out after a while but many devs would kill for that kind of success with a full price subscription game.	Exactly, $15 a month mmos are an outdated business model. newlinechar  newlinechar The 'next big game' will not be a $60 box with a $15 a month subscription, this is incredibly obvious if you watch the trend of which games are hitting huge numbers (LoL, World of Tanks, etc).
Not entirely accurate. Congress can declare war, but war can exist whether Congress declares it or not. The Founders specifically changed 'make War' to 'declare War'.	...But how do you make war without declaring it? If war is already being declared on us, we can defend, which is engaging in and thus 'making' war, but we can't send troops and weapons over to engage in the conflict of a country not engaged in war with us. That would be starting war. I'm not arguing, just explaining how I understand it. Am I wrong, or could you explain it better if I am wrong?

You can use context and other words to get your meaning across. You don't have to rely on a single word to get your meaning across. newlinechar  newlinechar Also you seem to think that this is a new phenomenon in language, or that it has been  somehow deliberately inserted into it. The first recorded usage of 'literally' used to mean 'figuratively' is from the late 1760's.  newlinechar  newlinechar How come you don't have a problem with other words that have two opposite meanings, such as 'to dust' or 'to cleave'?	[](/tsmyhorn) Of course I have problems with them! It's complete madness! Flammable and imflammable! **WHAT!?** ***AaaAaAAAaAAAAAgh!*** newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [](/tsawkward) Ahem. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [](/tsannoyed) The point is that 'literally' was a useful tool, regardless of where it came from and why it came, and why it's going. It was more useful being used to mean that something *literally* happened than as emphasis, in my opinion. Above all, there should be words to fill both niches. newlinechar  newlinechar [](/tsglare)  And *yes*, you can say 'I meant that as in it-actually-happened,' or 'for real!' or 'I'm *serious*' with a certain inflection et cetera et cetera... newlinechar  newlinechar But I want my word back!

but how would he know there should be leaves in the pool?	He would decide to do some chores, one of which was to skim the pool. He'd do it, forget he did it, and go to do it again. He'd then get confused and frustrated because he 'knew' it needed done (originally it did), but couldn't remember doing it. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing you never knew anybody with Alzheimer's or dementia.

This was three years ago, so it's been a while. I had been interested but not many of my friends play. Context for the post: I saw a group of kids back at my college playing, so I joined, thought it was mad cool but had to go to class so I didn't get much out of it. 	But, the meme didn't really convey that. Your meme was based off of a fantasy you had about boosting a nerd's self-esteem? Wow, that is the real cringe. It's not only you trying to play it off like you are wanted, but you made it up. Insecurity to the max. 
Upvote because I see your point but I dont believe kids think this deeply about things. To a child anything pink is considered girly and anything blue is for boys. 	A century ago it was the reverse.

F12 takes a screenshot in Steam.

More free time on a game that I can't play. What have I done to earn such generosity?	Yeah, me and my SO were just saying that. Seven extra free days doesn't mean jack if I can't play.

Sorry it's completely on the staff member that set the display model next to OP's. He shouldn't have done that without remembering which is which. Also, OP should have been stopped before he left the store with the display model. Blaming customers for staff mistakes is idiotic and the owner clearly doesn't get that concept.

I am in the US.  I would also venture to say that most people are convicted of a statute in their state, not a federal crime.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are certain cases where the state will prosecute. Drugs is a perfect example. Look at court proceedings and you will see the sate listed as the plaintiff. Same goes for domestic violence and murder.  However, the state does not assume the plaintiffs role for all types of crime. Only the biggies.  newlinechar  newlinechar Things can vary from state to state. In my state, if you get punched in the face right in front of a cop, but decline to prosecute, guess what happens? Nothing.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 	What state are you in? I strongly suspect you are incorrect. As far as I know, there are no jurisdictions in the US in which the victim's assent is necessary as you suggest. I am also quite sure you are incorrect that an individual will ever be the plaintiff in a criminal action. It is inherent to the nature of a criminal prosecution that the state must be the one prosecuting. At least under modern American law. 
 Oh I wasn't comparing squads at all. I'm just saying they've had a better window than us.	Have they though? They haven't addressed their weaknesses, just like we haven't.

Just because something has gone on for a long time does not mean it's a positive benefit.  newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, in this case, there is no liquidity increase. The buy order isn't placed unless there's a corresponding higher sell order to sell to. Thus the only difference from a direct change is the introduction of a parasitical middle-man. To claim otherwise is either to lie or to be taken in by a lie. 	*The buy order isn't placed unless there's a corresponding higher sell order to sell to* newlinechar  newlinechar This is how spreads get narrowed and liquidity becomes deeper. It doesn't need to sit on an exchange order book to count as economically valuable. The positive effects are real and measurable. newlinechar  newlinechar The act of closing the gap between buyers and sellers has been considered a good thing for centuries... it's econ 101 and is backed by both theory and data. When did this suddenly become a bad thing? Oh right, because HFT is scary.
The two centres I'd take over Shaq are Kareem and Hakeem, and I think I'd take Magic over him too. Possibly also Larry Bird and maybe LeBron.	I don't think you could justify taking Larry Bird.

So the jazz played faster than the suns? I was going more for the point of the suns don't really focus on defense because they focus on getting as many baskets as possible. They don't win by stopping you, they win by straight up out scoring you. I don't think Utah played this way, ESP in late 90s because of the age of their key players, I could be wrong though because I haven't seen every single Utah game from the 90s	I mean the Jazz had a way of controlling the game tempo, so the Suns may not have been able to run their offense as fast as they were used to against the Jazz.

It's a lot of things regarding the history of the original construction, the 1993 and 2001 attacks, and the reconstruction.

I sincerely hope it does. Seriously who the fuck asked for a second sequel? People don't even like the 13 cast all that much--certainly not enough to warrant a third game. 	For some reason, Toriyama gained a lot of influence within SE and they let him do whatever he wanted for an entire console generation. Additionally, they've been reusing a lot of assets with the XIII games which has helped SE during this difficult financial time for them.
Dude, get a bigger overflow. I have the same brand overflow, but in a larger size...... And mine is on a much smaller aquarium.

If you're going to do that, you might as well save money on a smaller pump too. newlinechar  newlinechar My advice, keep the pump, and go with the [1000 instead.](http://www.amazon.com/Eshopps-AEO11010-Overflow-Pf-1000-Aquarium/dp/B001K5K8TW/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377996393&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Eshopps+PF-1000) You'll actually be able to turn your return pump all the way up, and get most usage over both pieces of equipment. Plus, you want that sucker to go as high as you can get it. A higher turnover on a tank that size would be a good thing. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, don't forget to clean your filter sock at least twice a week. They get dirty quick, and if you don't keep them clean, they'll cause problems.	High turnover on a tank is good. But not completely through the sump. You only want your flow through the sump to be equal to or slightly above your protein skimmer rate.  newlinechar  newlinechar Sumps usually are 5-10 times turnover which for this is 250-500gph. 300gph sump is on the low end but op could upgrade it to the next one and downsize their return pump to 600gph (headloss will reduce it to about 300gph depending on the pump)

&gt;Similarly the moral fact that if killing is wrong, then killing your brother is wrong, is objective because it does not depend for its truth on your or my beliefs. newlinechar  newlinechar Wouldn't the 'moral fact' be 'killing is wrong', and not 'if... then killing your brother is wrong'? The latter just seems like a logical conclusion to the former.  newlinechar  newlinechar At the very least, the latter doesn't seem like a moral fact any more than 'if [combination of chemicals found in farts] are smelly, then farts are smelly' is a 'stink fact'. That is, it's true, but it seems misleading to label it a 'stink fact' because it's worded in such a way that you literally cannot reasonably deny that 'stink facts' exist. And yet, when people deny the existence of 'moral facts', it seems like they're addressing something slightly different.	The phrase you need is *direct moral facts*. Direct moral facts are facts which entail the existence of first order moral properties. An example is 'you ought to prevent some bad events'

&gt;Damiana, JWH-018 newlinechar  newlinechar Really, will that help?	It will make sure people know what is in each blend. A concentration listing ( ie. 100mg JWH-018 per 1g leaf or something) would help as well. But putting a warning label on it isn't going to stop anyone.  newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think anyone goes to buy a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of booze and decides to not consume it because of the warning on the side? People are going to do it regardless, might as well give them the name of the drug that they're consuming so the smart ones at least CAN do research on it before they consume it. ATM it's just a crapshoot, if you buy an herbal blend, you might have a general idea based on what is currently legal what is in it, but you can't be sure what it is nor can you be sure about the concentration.

If you're trying to imply that the growth of League has caused this than you're really misguided. This is becoming the most upvoted comment in almost every negative news thread recently and it's just not accurate. newlinechar  newlinechar If LoL wasn't around, these organisations would be leaving the industry entirely. League's success doesn't change the fact that Korean interest in SC2 is declining. I am stunned that people are still clinging on to this idea that LoL is responsible for SC2's decline in Korea as if eSports is some kind of zero-sum game where growth in one game has to be met by decline in another. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd agree with you in that growth of other eSports don't necessarily help SC2 but the growth of League hasn't negatively impacted SC2 in any significant way. newlinechar  newlinechar StarCraft in Korea is largely responsible for its own decline.	If it wasn't lol, it would have been some other game that killed sc2 in korea. Sc2 peaked interests across the board, but lost it due to high specs, lack of free model for home play and stuff like that. Contrary to popular beliefs, most peoples home pcs in korea suck
I've no interest in Hitler, or his quotes. Clearly, you do.	I really don't to be honest, I didn't go searching for the first quote I posted, I stumbled upon it on the front page.

I always got the impression that AMG operated more like a skunkworks whereas the M division operated more like a traditional engineering firm.  That is to say that M cars are designed to be uncompromising speed machine with all the comfort and practicality you'd expect from a luxury sedan, whereas AMG's primary goal was to make cars that are Awesome with a capital A even if that means sacrificing in other areas (ride comfort comes to mind).	Lol, my 328 convertible isn't a comfortable ride. Low profile tires + runflats + sports package is anything but comfortable. So I don't think the m3 is a comfortable car, the new 3 series isn't as rough though. 
There is still a tactical view. 	I fear it will be little more than a dodgy camera angle. If the enemies can be defeated in real time with ease then tactical view and setting up attacks seems pointless. Sort of like if 99 knights had a tactical view, what would be the point? The attacks are interchangeable and meaningless. I hope this isn't the case for dragon age and they figure out a way to make combat interesting through varied attacks which actually do different things and through stellar enemy ai. In my personal opinion I think we will just end up with Dragon Age 2 but with more bells and whistles, I hope not though. I don't want one 'press X repeatedly to win' move, I want different moves for different situations, where poor choice of move and poor timing lead to being punished. I also really don't want combos, or 'chain' attacks. Never has there been an action/rpg game with combos which doesn't feel like a button masher.

I don't find doing pointless things fun. The combat in Oblivion and Skyrim was slightly better, but it was still bad combat compared to other games. None of the quests were fun because the game played them for me with the quest compass, telling me where to go and what to do, and in Oblivion, everything was scaled so there was no sense of progression or achievement. The only 'fun' things were within the first few hours of playing going through dungeons and playing with physics, before you realized that there were 200 dungeons all made by the same poor bastard and most of them pointless. newlinechar  newlinechar Finding a dungeon in Morrowind felt important because there were far fewer of them, and each one told a story, and they were NOT pointed out to you by a stupid compass 10 minutes before you're in sight range of them.  newlinechar  newlinechar I got EMOTION from Morrowind. The game was so well written, the world so well built, that you could get entirely sucked into it. Oblivion and Skyrim are riddled with awful hackey writing that pulls you out constantly, like a cheesey big budget summer movie. Oh you start the tutorial finding out you're the chosen one? Well, not really the chosen one, you've got destiny, you're chosen to... be the chosen one's errand boy. Okay that's...cool I guess? Must defend against this horrible civil war and daedra invasion that... no one else seems to care about, and except for portals appearing in the woods now and then, there's no evidence of any impending threat...  newlinechar  newlinechar Eck, just such a poorly realized game.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Basically what you're saying is, you like Skyrim's combat. And that is enough to call the game better than Morrowind. That just sounds absurd to me. If Skyrim had really great combat, that'd be one thing, but combat is often the most criticized part of Skyrim.

think this view is too narrow, tons of fw pilots who come out thinking they're good at pvp but are actually v bad and dont know how to fly anything bigger than a cruiser	That is undoubtedly true. Not everyone is going to be any good at anything there is to do out there. newlinechar  newlinechar However, if you've figured out the basics of flying a ship solo or in a small gang, you're well ahead of the average pilot.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, nullsec pilots who come out of some sov holding alliance where they rarely get a roaming fleet and only see pvp action when home defense fleets are up... all they've learned is how to lock a primary and follow an anchor. Individual skill is replaced by following fc commands. newlinechar  newlinechar I know which of the two I would rather have in my fleets. Eventually you get pilots who are good at all of it, of course, but they get there faster in smaller pvp or in pvp alliances that are always offensively focused (typically those who hole up in NPC 0.0). newlinechar

If you notice in the video they use wither parts for armour and his weapon is obisidian. Maybe have the wither spawn them we he gets hurt.	Eh, I dunno. The wither skeleton parts kind of imply that the brute killed them, so it'd be weird (and a bit overpowered) if wither skeletons spawned in by him. I think it's better if it was just the brute, as it's better to focus on just one larger and more challenging mob without it spawning all these other mobs to go after you.

Exactly this.  I once found myself in a place where legal pedestrian crossings are something like 1/2 mile apart.  Me, having arrived by train, looking for the address found myself on the wrong side of the street because the buildings don't have numbers facing the street and I'm half-way between the two crossings.   newlinechar  newlinechar So now what?  I've got got a 45 MPH street in front of me and 1000 ft to either crosswalk.  It took me 15 minutes to get to the other side because I have to walk about 1/2 mile and then 2 minutes wait to get the pedestrian cross signal.  And before I step off the curb, I have to wat for 3 cars turning against the red, and on the far side I had to wait in the street as 4 cars made right turn in front of me before someone stopped so I could go the last 15 ft to the curb.  WTF is this?   newlinechar  newlinechar Conversely, if I arrived by car and found myself in the wrong parking lot, I could have exited the parking lot, go into the center turning lane, and then into the parking lot across the street.  Done in what?  30 seconds?  1 minute? newlinechar  newlinechar 	At least we're in the first world. :/ There are places in developing countries (India and China notorously) where the road planners simply don't give a fuck.

Thank you very much! newlinechar When you say greens are you talking about leafy greens like spinach and such? (sorry I'm from a non-English speaking country so I just want to make sure I'm understanding you) newlinechar  newlinechar Are bell peppers and broccoli ok for this? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, should I use milk in the mixture or will it get soggy or strange after thawing if I do that? newlinechar  newlinechar One more thing, how should I freeze them? just put them in a freezer box straight from the oven or let them cool some/completely first? newlinechar  newlinechar Again, thank you so much for your reply :)	Yes, I meant leafy greens. Personally, I prefer something with a little more body, like chard, but spinach will work. If you're using frozen greens, defrost them and squeeze out the excess moisture first. Broccoli is another good choice, but peppers will go unpleasantly limp. newlinechar  newlinechar As for milk, I use it in scrambled eggs, but not in omelettes. It makes the eggs creamy, but reduces their structural integrity. newlinechar  newlinechar Cool your omelettes thoroughly in the refrigerator, wrap individually in plastic wrap and then freeze. That should keep the ice damage down to a minimum.
Not going to argue with that to much, but how else you going to let people know where  your business is located, without a sign.

The boxes simply slide (shown in the video by Nate) down rails to connect/disconnect.

Same here, a little, but it's kind of annoying when you're listening very closely to what's being said. Plus, music in videos like this is nice to help inspire but it's easily used to manipulate emotion so it's a little rude.	I can definitely agree with that. 
I'm an avid OneNote user. (OneNote 2010) newlinechar  newlinechar what's new in OneNote 2013? (except full screen mode)	I'm actually talking about the standalone version of OneNote. If you go into the windows store there's a metro version of OneNote that's not part of the office suite. newlinechar  newlinechar As for OneNote 2013 I haven't used it as much but nothing incredibly substantial has changed from 2010, which in my opinion is a good thing. It still doesn't support inserting video unfortunately (or at least I haven't found a reliable way), but having built-in SkyDrive support for syncing every notebook to all of your devices is phenominal.

Any ridiculing or feminist message kind of gets drowned out in tits.  newlinechar  newlinechar Even the lyrics of the original seem to indicate he's poking fun.

As this thread evolves, you may notice that no wannabe urban planners will jump in with comments about how shitty the layout is or how everything looks the same.

&gt; Shatner a dick? You know it. He laughed when DeForest Kelley's beloved dog died and they didn't speak for 10+ years newlinechar  newlinechar Not correct. They didn't speak for two years, not ten, but Kelley always had a great deal of respect for Shatner, and he called and requested that he come see him at the hospice shortly before his death. I think that was a situation where Shatner probably did behave like a bit of an A-hole, knowing what I do about what is said to have taken place at their last visit together. But the manner by which Kelley's dog died caused Shatner to laugh, as it was a Chihuahua, and the poor little dog ran into a sprinkler as it was turning, and when it hit him in the head, he died. Shatner heard the story and laughed on impulse. I won't defend it, but there are other people out there who might have reacted similarly to that story. Personally, I don't think it's funny at all, but I'm also a real softy when it comes to animals, but not everybody is. And it's not as though Shatner isn't an animal lover, because he is. He breeds horses and he has and loves dogs. So he probably had a bad moment that Kelley understandably found hard to forgive.	&gt; laughed on impulse newlinechar  newlinechar Not gonna lie, I gave a little chuckle as I winced.

I almost got a swirlie but thankfully someone intervened.  If he hadn't, it definitely would have happened - they already had me up in the air and headed towards the toilet.

Where did I doubt that bullying exists? I was just pointing out that those specific torture methods don't seem to happen nearly as much as they're portrayed in films. It's deeper than that.
Oh nice!  I'm glad that the lace is supposed to be like that. newlinechar  newlinechar As for wire width...err...I'm not sure.  I just looked it up, so I know that it is the 'diameter' of the cup.  But, I'm not sure how to make sure the wire width is okay.  The bra is tight, but none of the wires are poking into my sides or anything.  Is that what you mean?	The wire should follow your breast root. It shouldn't be too narrow (sitting on breast tissue) or too wide (empty space on the sides). If you wear the bra long enough to leave red marks you can compare the marks to your root to check the width.

Yeah, Socrates is as much of a sexist douche as the rest of the Greeks. Part of that dialogue's humor is that Socrates is doing to Theodota what he's teachig her to do to other people.

I swear, the remarkable thing is *not* Socrates; it's the *reactions* to him as described. People are always attentive and interested and almost never just tell him to fuck off. It's so strange... newlinechar  newlinechar If you're interested, there's a modern book 'The Ironic Defense of Socrates' or something like that which basically argues that Socrates basically manipulated and arranged his whole trial and execution as well, which put together a lot of little aspects of that whole thing that had always sort of eluded me. newlinechar  newlinechar That just adds a whole 'nother level of badass to it: not only does he make a long life trolling everyone in town, but then he decides to up his game a bit more to get them to sentence him to death to teach them another lesson once he gets bored...

Members of the Jury, people of Reddit,  I am here today to defend /u/douglasmacarthur on charges of KimJongUn.rar.   I understand that this is a divisive case, but I ask that you remember to try it according to the facts, and remember that unless the prosecution proves their case, he must be found not guilty.  There are two  key factors that support the declaration of /u/douglasmacarthur not guilty on all charges. newlinechar  newlinechar First, I bring your attention to the âSubreddit Independence Doctrineâ  which is the legal precedent in this court that moderators are entitled to manage their subreddit as they see fit.   A justice of this court made a statement, which is required to be accepted as binding legal opinion by this court.   He said âIf the moderator team decides they don't want a domain in their sub, that's that. Moderating is not a democracy.â  I would like to remind the jury that they must judge the defendant according to this statement, as it carries the force of law. newlinechar  newlinechar Second,   I bring attention to the fact that unless the prosecution can prove beyond reasonable doubt that  newlinechar the defendant had an ulterior motive in banning Russia Today, the defendant must be found Not Guilty.  Unless the prosecution can present a statement by the defendant that confirms these allegations, they must be considered false. newlinechar  newlinechar I urge the jury to consider the implications of their decision and the law of this court while making their decision, which must be outright acquittal. newlinechar

The *only* 'negative reaction' to this post came from /u/UpvotesAllWhoReply, and even his reaction was pretty tepid, far from the 'name calling' that you allege took place. newlinechar  newlinechar Or are we not allowed to criticize the idea of an imminent post-scarcity society?
Haha thanks man. I'm not really sure what I wanted to know to be honest... newlinechar  newlinechar Do you like your classes? How big is the department? Do the students seems to be interested in the subject or just looking for an easy A? How liberal/conservative are the people on campus? Are there many international students who go to IU? newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry if that's overwhelming, any answers/opinions you could give would be much appreciated. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Also, how many logic classes are offered? At Purdue we only have one undergraduate logic course and I've already taken it.	I like my classes. I have taken about 70 credit hours between the Phil department and the History and Philosophy of Science departments. Our professors are very very good as a whole.  newlinechar  newlinechar The department is relatively small, but if you add the HPS department it becomes pretty big. You can find info/faculty lists on both of those departments through google. newlinechar  newlinechar The students are VERY interested in the subject, outside of 100-level classes of course. I find that the students I have met in Philosophy classes are by far more interested and intelligent than students in the other departments I have been in such as Political Science and Criminal Justice. newlinechar  newlinechar The campus is very liberal, but there are also conservatives of course and they are fairly liberal themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar 6k of our 45k students are international, which makes us one of the highest % international state schools. newlinechar  newlinechar I can get very deep into the details of the strengths and weaknesses of the philosophy and HPS departments (subfield wise) as well, if you'd like.
I think what he means is that the existence, non-existence of god can be verified as an empirical fact, depending on ones definition of god.  Whether a god exists is a matter to be left to science. newlinechar  newlinechar Feminism, anti-racism, and other facets of social justice on the other hand rely on ethical tenants like 'racism is wrong' which are not inconsistent with atheism, but also not directly related. newlinechar  newlinechar I believe the relationship between social justice and atheism only exists due to cultural context.  Because many traditional religions promote bigotry, the rejection of religion often results in individuals becoming increasingly tolerant. newlinechar 	&gt; I think what he means is that the existence, non-existence of god can be verified as an empirical fact, depending on ones definition of god. newlinechar  newlinechar It can be, if one defines god in a way that the vast majority of people alive today do not. I probably shouldn't have bothered with that point, because it's completely off topic to the discussion at hand. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Feminism, anti-racism, and other facets of social justice on the other hand rely on ethical tenants like 'racism is wrong' which are not inconsistent with atheism, but also not directly related. newlinechar  newlinechar This is an oversimplification. Try 'racism is wrong, because there is no evidence showing why one should treat one race better or worse than another'. Just like 'god is a human creation, because there's no evidence to show that it exists'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I believe the relationship between social justice and atheism only exists due to cultural context. Because many traditional religions promote bigotry, the rejection of religion often results in individuals becoming increasingly tolerant. newlinechar  newlinechar This is partially correct, but you discard evidence based discussion on bigotry. If someone uses evidence or logic as a reason to discard one claim, god, they should also be willing to use it on other topics. The 'null hypothesis' would be to treat people equally, anything that deviates from that requires evidence to be shown.
Tell us more about you two! Sounds like a good story :)	Well it's a bit of a long-winded story, but I'll give the short and sweet version because I'm typing this on my phone (and we all know how much fun that is). newlinechar  newlinechar We grew up around the corner from each other, and we had play dates when we were very little. We went to preschool together, and then my family moved a couple towns away so we lost touch. In high school, he and my brother reconnected because they both sang in accapella groups for their schools. We both ended up going to the same college (300 miles from home, so a kind of weird coincidence) and ran into each other and recognized each other. We decided to grab dinner to catch up, which turned into a date, and we've been together ever since (almost 4 years)! newlinechar  newlinechar Meeting the parents was much less stressful than usual because I'd already met them ~20 years previously!

I think that him ignoring his KG duties to help his family actually makes the most sense. When he joins the KG Jaime says Lora's is pretty much him when he was younger so having Loras ruin his honor would actually make sense. 	His KG duties involve helping his family because his sister is the queen. Two of them are the only members of the Tyrell family with unlimited access to the Red Keep. What can be gained by his hiding at Dragonstone or joining the Redwyne' fleet? His presence in the Red Keep gives his family much more advantage while anything outside the KL could easily be handled by other Tyrells.

This is why headlines have become the best way to sell your agenda. newlinechar  newlinechar If you read the headlines of the same story on sites with opposite political affiliation (Reddit vs Drudge Report, MSNBC vs FOXNews, etc), you'll find that there's a degree of ... editorializing with the headlines. newlinechar  newlinechar For an example, imagine a republican senator making a speech on 'traditional marriage' on the senate floor, which results in an outcry against him from various gay rights groups. The headlines will look something like this: newlinechar  newlinechar - Reddit: 'Gay-bashing Republican Senator John Smith gets slammed by Jon Stewart' newlinechar  newlinechar - MSNBC: 'Florida Republican John Smith facing pressure from gay rights groups after anti-gay rant' newlinechar  newlinechar - Fox: 'Senator Smith (R-FL) responds to criticism of his speech on family values' newlinechar  newlinechar - Drudge: 'Senator John Smith threatened by gay-rights groups after speech on Thursday'. newlinechar  newlinechar All 4 articles may end up having the same facts - but the way they're presented gives a totally different story. The relative importance of the party of the controversial figure depends on the way the story is intended to be taken, as is how you're intended to react to it. The further 'left' you go, the more the article's headline is telling you that his statements are absurd. The further right you go, the more they're focused on the cleanup after, and the reaction of other parties rather than the actual event. newlinechar  newlinechar Watch for it sometime. You'll be surprised how often it happens.	Once you learn that, you can see past the bullshit and get news from lots of sources. My old boss thought it was irresponsible for me to read al jazzera because he couldn't see any way I could digest the information without being brainwashed. 
There's a concept in kosher called 'yad soledet bo' or basically something being too hot to touch with your hand. When something is that hot, it takes on the 'taste' of whatever you're cooking (meat or milk). So cold cereal and milk in a bowl won't stop one from using that same bowl to prepare raw beef later but once you eat a hot bowl of chili from it (skipping over other contingencies in kosher) you couldn't use that bowl for dairy products again.  newlinechar  newlinechar So in short, common sense tells us not to touch something too hot.

Yeah, the international view of the A-league (seen on /r/soccer and such) is that Heskey and ADP are it''s biggest stars. But you don't hear much about Heskey in the league when compared to ADP, Ono, Rojas etc. He seem's to have been very much caught in their shadows.    	Watching Newcastle in the second half of the year, you could see how skilled he is but teams worked hard to 2v1 him all day and cut off his service from the wings meaning they were reduced to long high balls into the channels but even when he won the header the other team worked to get the second ball.  Where as ADP and Ono won games off their boot, Heskey wasn't able to lift his team to those heights but that is because the other 9 players weren't able to do their thing as well as they should on paper not for lack of skill or work. I think this is why we're not taking about him like Ono or ADP.
I was an idiot and didn't scout the take off before jumping off because it wasn't that big of a drop.

He felt compassion for the ordinary village people who were ripped off on a daily basis by the city folk, the comprador parasites. He built an army to defend the countryside from these power-wielding robbers. Pol Pot,  a monkish man of simple needs, did not seek wealth, fame or power for himself.

It sure seems that way, given the wording 'Your chain of thought could be extended...', but I think his point is quite the opposite of the slippery slope fallacy. He's saying that it's *reasonable and appropriate* to draw a line somewhere across the slope, and that the original commenter is applying the principle so broadly that he bars reasonable nomenclature. 	No, /u/hoodunnit's arguing that if we do X, this will lead to Y, via a slippery slope. X is 'stop using pat labels for fallacies' and Y is 'stop using labels for anything.' That is a classic slippery slope argument. It's also fallacious because my chain of thought *can't* be extended in this manner - my argument is that fallacies ought not to be used because the label itself is uninformative, naming as it does the structure rather than the content. This does not apply to every esoteric term - in fact most name the content of the idea they refer to, not the structure. newlinechar  newlinechar Notice that this would've been evident had I just said *this* in reply, rather than saying 'that's a fallacy' as I so hilariously did.

&gt;Most psychedelics are 100% safe.

For LSD the lethal dose would be around 12,000 ug, a really high dose to get high is 400+ug, so it would be really hard to overdose on LSD from recreational use. I think the other two drugs mentioned are similar. newlinechar  newlinechar Not to say that makes them safe just that you aren't likely to overdose on them like you could with say heroin or something.
A friend once told me that the original director died while making this film and that Steven Speilberg took over to end the filming.

He fits perfectly fine. hes just as good a jungler as Fenrir, his heal is his sustain (As fenrirs life steal on his howl) He has a very good slow, good ticking damage ability, and a good ult. Of course hes not meant for solo lane. Hes just another choice for jungling (Fenrir, Thor, even herc can jungle) Bruiser jungling has and always will be a thing	You don't need hp sustain as a jungler, at least not from abilities. That is the issue. It doesn't help ganks and it doesn't help jungling. It is meant for team fights, but even then a bruiser is meant to focus a carry and will be less likely than a tank to be in range of his team to heal them. If you are spending mana on your heal to get 50-100 hp every once in a while then you are screwing yourself over as it is not worth the mana cost. newlinechar  newlinechar The only time a heal is useful on a jungler is during the early levels. And it doesn't do any damage, so it isn't feasible to take guan's heal before level 4. By then he can fully recoup his hp in the jungle with just Bumbas anyway, so it is terribly pointless for 'sustain' in that role. And I'm not sure if you've really played much Guan in the jungle role since his rework, but you run out of mana ridiculously fast despite the 15 mp5 from bumbas. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also not sure why you say Guan has a good slow. His slow is complete garbage. 20% is nothing. And compared to all of the other junglers, Guan has no ganking power. He does less burst and has less CC than all of the top junglers. Those are the 2 most important aspects of a roamer. It is the reason you see Athena used effectively as a jungler--she has powerful CC, mobility, and burst. newlinechar  newlinechar Guan has a 1.5 second stun and a 20% slow. His total damage combo takes about 9 seconds. newlinechar  newlinechar Fenrir has a 1 second stun and a 2 second stun/pull/carry. His total damage combo takes about 4 seconds. newlinechar  newlinechar Thor has a 1.6 second stun, a 1.5 second stun, and a wall. His total damage combo takes about 4 seconds. newlinechar  newlinechar Ne Zha has a 1 second stun, a 4 second 'banish'-semi-stun (during the lift and drop of the ult banish), and a 25% slow. His total damage combo takes 6 seconds, but late game he can just 2-shot you with his 3 and ult unless you are a tank. newlinechar  newlinechar Hun Batz has a 50% slow and a 2 second huge aoe persistent fear that counters resolve. His full damage combo takes about 3-4 seconds. newlinechar  newlinechar ------------------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar Now why on earth would you pick Guan for the jungling role? He doesn't have a crazy fast clear. He has the worst CC of these five. He has the second worst mobility of these 5. He has the worst burst of these 5. He has the weakest auto attacks of these 5. What is the purpose of a Guan Yu pick in the jungle? He is simply outclassed. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, don't get me wrong. I don't think he's bad. I think he has a good kit. It is a fairly powerful one. The issue is that it isn't viable for any role he is meant to fill. He can't jungle with it, and he can't solo side lane with it. That is the issue I am having. They changed his kit to be good for a role in a meta that no longer exists, and now he doesn't fit the new role he should be used in according to the shifted meta because his strengths compare too unfavorably to the other gods in that role.

Your number is worldwide; mine is US (both just approximate--I found other estimates, but they are in the ballpark). So just back-of-envelope, I am assuming they take all their profits worldwide and pay them out to US employees. I know that is a silly assumption--I just was looking for some way to set the profits number and employee number side by side in a way that was intuitively comparable.	I am not sure where you got your figure from either though. This says that there are [760,000 in the United States](http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/talking-numbers/15-hour-wage-mean-mcdonald-170436977.html). newlinechar  newlinechar Also, you have to figure the difference between the corporation and the franchises. A lot of the revenue the corporation comes doesn't just derive from the share of sales of each store. They also make profits off of things that are expenses for each individual franchise (such as selling products and charging a huge premium for the business itself). That is a bit of a tangent, but you really need to look at each store as a separate business with a separate owner. They all need to make sure cash flow is positive regardless of how well the entire corporation is doing.

Muted flavors and slightly bitter? You may want to change the ratio by upping your dose weight.

If you try to roll the bike backwards you'll end up on the floor again. The leverage of the stand should be enough to get it up there. There should be no effort except for the initial balance and your foot on the stand. newlinechar  newlinechar Stand on the kick stand. Once it's firmly planted you can put all your weight on it. For my heavy VFR I used to stand one footed on the thing and the bike would just sort of roll up there. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Also I did exactly the same thing with my first bike. Luckily the ground caught it.	That's partially right, you should be standing on the center stand AND simultaneously lifting the rear of the bike with your right arm.

The acclimatiser can get most bees to work in most biomes. However, the limitation is that you can only get both_4 for temperature.

Yeah the funny thing as somebody that's always been underweight myself, just like fat people way underestimate their caloric intake, underweight people way overestimate the amount of calories they get per day (but just can't seem to gain weight).

My guess is that $15/hr is just a catchy number that doesn't seem too big to the workers. The more aware workers probably know that number is unfeasible, but sometimes in tense negotiations it can help to hi-ball it.

Ooh, I've read about this.  In *some* extreme circumstances, fan death is real. newlinechar  newlinechar If it is very hot (like 110-130F) and you have a fan on in a room with inadequate ventilation, having a fan on could kill you.  Normally, the air *right* around  your body will reach about your body temperature.  Talking a very thin layer of air here.  But that layer keeps your body from being heated up to the 130F room temp.  It insulates you.  So if you fall asleep in such a room, and there's a fan on, it will keep all of the hot air circulating as you sleep.  And eventually your body will run out of sweat, and you will overheat, and die. newlinechar  newlinechar So it is possible.  Usually for the sick, the elderly, or the very young. newlinechar  newlinechar *geez, what are you all upset about.  [Here is what I read about it](http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2009/01/fan-death-is-real.html)	Pretty sure that moving that 'air envelope' is why fans normally cool you off.

You're right in a way. It does sometimes cause people to hit the gym- because they've internalized that they are somehow worthless if they're not in shape. And that's not cool, at least to me. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically- people should be encouraged to go to the gym because they want to be strong, not because they are ashamed of themselves for being weak.

And to be clear, the shame that was put on me as a child was not done with my benefit in mind. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, it seems to me that the general disdain for obese people comes from a biological/evolutionary source. Those who were overweight could not work as hard, or contribute as much physical labor to the society, and so they were shunned. I'd imagine that females have in their genetics a general aversion to obesity as well, as those who were obese would be less likely to be able to support children and would generally live shorter lives. I'm talking before the industrial revolution here. Fast forward to today, and obesity is set to become *the* major health crisis of the 21st century, costing billions in taxpayer moneys.  newlinechar  newlinechar As terrible as it sounds, some of these reasons for disdain make sense to me. Of course, the correct response is to try and help these people - after all, only a tiny, tiny percentage of them actually want to be fat. Unfortunately, we're more impatient than we've ever been, and that will play out in the way we address the obesity epidemic, I'm sure.

This is a vole. 	Oh, I totally forgot about voles. Voles resemble a mouse but have a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. Voles are small rodents that grow to 3â9 in (7.6â23 cm), depending on the species. They can have five to 10 litters per year. Gestation lasts for three weeks and the young voles reach sexual maturity in a month. As a result of this exponential growth, vole populations can grow very large within a very short period of time. Since litters average five to 10 young, a single pregnant vole can result in a hundred or more active voles in less than a year. Voles are commonly mistaken for other small animals. Moles, gophers, mice, rats and even shrews have similar characteristics and behavioral tendencies. Since voles will commonly use burrows with many exit holes, they can be mistaken for gophers or some kind of ground squirrel. They will readily thrive on small plants. Like shrews, they will eat dead animals and, like mice or rats, they can live on almost any nut or fruit. Additionally, voles will target plants more than most other small animals, making their presence evident. Voles will readily girdle small trees and ground cover much like a porcupine. This girdling can easily kill young plants and is not healthy for trees or other shrubs. Voles will often eat succulent root systems and will burrow under plants or ground cover and eat away until the plant is dead. Bulbs in the ground are another favorite target for voles; their excellent burrowing and tunnelling skills give them access to sensitive areas without clear or early warning. The presence of large numbers of voles is often only identifiable after they have destroyed a number of plants. However, like other burrowing rodents, they also play beneficial roles, including dispersing nutrients throughout the upper soil layers. Unfortunately this guy had a poor ending :/
At least we're in the first world. :/ There are places in developing countries (India and China notorously) where the road planners simply don't give a fuck.

My United Airlines flight back from Frankfurt was delayed by two hours, which would have made me miss my connection back to Michigan.  Instead of fixing it properly, they changed my flight to a Lufthansa one instead, which *also* meant that I couldn't get to my connection in time, and they knew it.  I told them it wouldn't give me enough time but the people at the United counter told me to not worry and I'll make it just fine.  Total bullshit.  So when I get to DC and I miss my flight, United claims it isn't their fault and that Lufthansa should arrange my way home.  Lufthansa says its United's fault because they were the ones that switched my flight.  So I had to do some yelling at the United people, I was almost making a scene.

You aren't disadvantaged, you would have to travel anyway. The alternative is making Geelong travel to etihad, which disadvantages them. Since they would have similar crowds, they decided to give Geelong the reward they deserve, and a home final.

The problems that he talks about in the video are somewhat unique to Battlefield because it started life as a PC game and the PC version is generally considered superior. That's not really the case with CoD. LoL is only on PC. So I feel like he is complaining about something that is typical of the entire PC platform (elitists) and painting the Battlefield community in a bad light. newlinechar  newlinechar He also downplays any notion of the immaturity/kids/frat bros etc... on the consoles as if it's no big deal. It's a huge deal. It's why I refuse to buy any multiplayer console game. I don't look down upon those who choose to play console versions, but those same players should not be offended when PC players point out player counts and map size. The games, despite being similar, play differently. newlinechar  newlinechar In the end, people didn't like his videos so he uses the community as a scapegoat. Lazy train of thought and, in the end, no better than the people he is complaining about. 	I saw a post by Wintergore where he called the 'console' gamers he was playing against bots and he get's upvoted for it. newlinechar  newlinechar Great community where insulting someone's platform of choice get's you support.
There's only so far you can defocus.

I've been defocusing for years now. I can force it wayyyy past normal, so for me it's easier. YMMV I guess.

[Gunsmith Cats](http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=1165). The main character often stops to tell about the gun she's using, or the ammo or anything related to it.

Well it's still going to viewed as ultimately pointless by most gamers, by some point in time of playing.. I completely see where you're coming from, but DayZ will never the next huge game, unless it is truly polished in a way that more casual gamers could play it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure everyone who has played DayZ for more than a few hours can say that they have experienced that nerve wrecking excitement as well as terror, but even that eventually wears off, leading to pointlessness.

The composition is terrible, the proportions of Joker's face is absurdly large compared to the torso, the vectoring of the suit is sloppy, the silhouette/posture is more GQ than joker, the type choice doesn't fit the background, the vector style, or the background, the type treatment itself is nothing special and the typesetting is straight up abhorrent, the background looks like something straight off a google image search for grunge, but worst of allâpast all the little wrongs and flaws is that there is no cohesive style in this whole composition.

Thats the real beauty of it. Open relationships are non-traditional and are thus totally flexible and customizeable. Every open relationship is different depending on the wants and needs of thos in it. newlinechar  newlinechar We live in an interesting day and age where more and more non-traditional relationships are becoming more and more mainstream.

And theres just so much to the lifestyle. So many different ways of taking it. From bongs to fruit. The people you meet from doing it.

Thank you, this is great. Although I'm not sure this meets my needs, since the issue we were having was with the linux module nf_conntrack.

Ass always on my mind dawg.	I see my teachings have spread far and wide
I am not allowed to exercise too much, per my doctor's orders, because I faint when I do. I try to walk around the park next to my house a couple times, which helps. I haven't been able to listen to some of my favorite music, play my favorite games or read my beloved books because it just depresses me. But I will get through this. I am not going to give up. &lt;3 newlinechar  newlinechar Love you too, dear.	:( I'm glad you've been able to get outside once in a while. Have you tried any of Amazon's free music or grooveshark to get into bands you don't already know? &lt;3 I could recommend a few if you want. Love you lots. You're a trooper.
would be hilarious if eren just keeps getting saved then eaten again later and it keeps repeating.	Now that you mentioned it...
I agree with that, but they are consistent.  Just not consistent with the rule book.  If they were consistent with the rule book pitchers would have to come inside which is fine by me. newlinechar  newlinechar But this is the way it is.  I'm not arguing with anybody.  All I'm saying is Murphy hasn't been able to make the adjustment when other left handers have.  When he has in the past.  Nothing new here.	And I bet if that Ump would've never called that a strike against another lefty like Cano, but because Murphy is marginal he calls all sorts of junk strikes.
so it was literally, too ambitious. newlinechar  newlinechar my point is that, something trying to be too ambitious IS a bad thing. Just look at all the bad press it got.

Do you not live in a town with bike lanes? Where I live, biking is very prominent and respected, but there are a lot of hipsters, so it makes sense. But point being, bike lanes are very good at making driving for both cyclist and motorist convenient. 	Where I live now they are interspersed throughout the city, but I would still never test my luck. Where I used to live we didn't have lanes but we had tons of bike clubs and races come through--it's one of those small nor-cal wine towns). I almost ran over my fair share of spandex there. They never stopped for stop signs, clog sections of the roads forcing driver into opposing lanes, and one time ths guy pulled across 3 lanes of a 45mph zone going maybe 15mph, long story short it was almost tour de splat. I understand what he did was legal, but I don't think it should be.

I'm saving that for future use.	800 numbers can actually use 555, so it might actually be a real number. They had that problem in 'The Last of Us' where the phone numbers on in-game billboards (1800-555-****) linked to actual phone sex hotlines. 
The TOBS is definitely a quality cream. I'm almost through my tub. I'm from Las Vegas, so I used it because I also had hard water. It works very well, there's a reason why it's popular. I bought the Barrister and Mann now that I'm back at school in DC and have soft water. To be honest, I haven't found a cream/soap other than col conk with a bad lather (and that was because I didn't realize I had hard water). It's just a matter of slick vs cushion. TOBS is more slick to me. Barrister and Mann is more in between, but leaning towards cushion. As with anything, YMMV. newlinechar  newlinechar Leisureguy also talks about distilled water shaves for soaps if you have hard water. Perhaps give that a go?

What? Eren didn't do that bad. He sent her flying with an uppercut after she punched his jaw off! And he got her into a full mount, if it wasn't for his inexperience with controlling his titan body and unstable mental state at the time making him lose control, he would have been able to capitalize on his superior position and take her down. Obviously, the Female Titan has more experience fighting with and using her titan body.	I know he did as best as he could but it would have been so much better to get one of his super punches to land. Each time he moved the female titan's eyes went wide thinking she would get injured in someway but nope. He did well in the beginning but after going mental just tapered off.
I hope you realize that this is not fact, but a historical theory ... one that religious Jews disagree with for obvious reasons. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not a historian or archaeologist, but I do know the word 'El' has many meanings, including 'god' (lowercase) and 'power/ful'. In fact, it is used in the Torah, sometimes referring to God, sometimes to idols (gods), much in the same way that the word 'god/God' is used in English. Accordingly, there would be many many things called 'el'; anyone speaking any hebrew-related language would be calling their god 'el'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; there were no Jews newlinechar  newlinechar To my knowledge, while there are a lot of theories about the origins of the Israelites and others in the region, these are all theories and anyone can come up with one: if it sounds plausible enough, and/or exciting enough, it can get published. So you can imagine that I don't appreciate you stating a historical theory as an assertion of fact ... on a subreddit about Judaism (as a Jew). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 	Sorry!

They didn't feel comfortable with either kicker, plus this shows that this FO feels that kickers are a dime a dozen.

&gt; With world hunger still an issue, you can effectively say these regulations are causing certain people starvation newlinechar  newlinechar Our meat processing rules have precisely nothing to do with the grain supply in rural Africa. I'm not sure what argument you're even trying to make - if we allowed more food poisonings, kids in Africa wouldn't die of malnutrition? There is no reason at all why we couldn't have 100% of people eating food with nearly 0% getting food poisoning.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If a group of people, being poisoned by food, would not choose to have a lawyer prosecute the poisoned food source, despite the cost, then the issue of the poisoned food isn't really a big issue to them, is it? newlinechar  newlinechar That's my point exactly - say it costs $10,000 to hire a lawyer for your case, but the damages done are $9,000. Are you going to bother? No. But who *benefits* from this - you're still out $9,000 worth of your life, and the company has paid precisely zero for their actions. Just because an arbitrary service like 'hiring a lawyer' is greater than the damage **does not mean the damage is not a 'big issue' to them**. That is the fundamental problem I have with libertarianism - you assume away transaction costs to the detriment of reality. newlinechar  newlinechar As for your brother - how does he know it was the burger? The odds of getting food poisoning from meat are actually lower than the odds of getting it from leafy greens. You're making the assumption that it was Applebees, but you *don't know*. You assume you have perfect information (you don't), then base your conclusions off of that. *Basing your conclusions on incorrect assumptions will never end well.* 	&gt; There is no reason at all why we couldn't have 100% of people eating food with nearly 0% getting food poisoning. newlinechar  newlinechar Certainly in the future; but as of now, simple Economics will tell you these regulations will reduce with quantity supplied of Food. While starvation still exists, I can only imagine that with more lax regulations, quantity supplied would increase, thus decreasing starvation instances.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  But who benefits from this - you're still out $9,000 worth of your life, and the company has paid precisely zero for their actions. newlinechar  newlinechar The lack of judicial change would only tell consumers to instead purchase foods from different, respectable companies. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; As for your brother - how does he know it was the burger?  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, considering my brother only had the meat portion (no bun, toppings, etc.) I think his assumption was more valid than you make it out to seem. Furthermore, people can pinpoint foods that make them severely ill; and remove it from their diets. Taste Aversion is a powerful psychological trait.  newlinechar

Look 'dude', people drive cars more then they ride motorcycles. Very few motorcycles even get ridden 1k miles a year, let alone rack up enough miles to hit 200k.

Sportbikes do not last as long as cars. End of story. They are built to run very fast, not very long. You cannot have a 4-cycle motor that revs to 15k rpm last as long as a traditional 4-cylinder car motor.

Cost vs. Benefit newlinechar  newlinechar The cost it takes to give out a cup, and fill it with water is less than the cost that will come from permanently losing a customer (possibly more, word of mouth spreads quick) newlinechar  newlinechar So, it's either lose a few dollars now, and save a possible future repeat customer.. or save a couple of dollars and lose all business from this customer (possibly more) in the future. newlinechar  newlinechar It would have been smarter just to fill the cup with water and give it to the customer.	There's also the philosophy that people who are looking for things for free are not buying anything, therefore they are not going to be customers anyway. As a patron, I'm fine with paying 25Â¢ for a cup.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit - if the customer is already purchasing something, it makes sense to give them the water and cup.

This one doesn't seem that crazy to me. You see gyms go out of business all the time, usually due to financial hardship. When you start to break down the costs it starts to become a bit more reasonable. newlinechar  newlinechar * Gyms are usually a lot of square footage, which means an expensive lease. newlinechar  newlinechar * Staffing costs including your management and any specialists your bring in. newlinechar  newlinechar * Exercise equipment itself is very expensive. Lots of use, more than home equipment, so you're looking at lots of maintenance and replacement. newlinechar  newlinechar * Utilities or TMI is probably massive for such a large space. newlinechar  newlinechar * Advertising and marketing. A competitive space means you need to get yourself out there. newlinechar  newlinechar * Commercial cleaning company. newlinechar  newlinechar * Constant upgrades and improvements to make sure you're keeping up with all of the current trends, and to make sure your gym doesn't look like a dump. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure there's a lot more that could be added to this list, but you get the idea. The thing that *really* bugs me about almost every gym  I've ever had dealings with is their ridiculous client management and billing practices. I can't think of another industry as wonky as the health industry for thinking they can just bill you whatever they want, whenever they want.

&gt;$1,350,000: Mac and Linux Versions newlinechar &gt; newlinechar &gt;Why should Windows users get to hog all the fun? Now we can offer Mighty No. 9 on both Mac and Linux as well! newlinechar  newlinechar Not get me wrong, I love the Megaman series, but sadly as a result of some shady kickstarters I'm concerned when the Linux support is reduced to a stretch goal.

It's not quite like that. I haven't explained it well. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically now English is far more important than any other subject to pass high school which is now incorporated into all subjects. Which sucks for someone like me who is more of a mathematical person. newlinechar  newlinechar 	Our experiences have been different then. My school favoured maths/science at the expense of creative subjects (not that math/science can't be creative, but they aren't taught very creatively at school level) Certainly there is far more funding for the latter at university level. There is a disdain for 'useless subjects' which are intellectual but not practical in terms of leading directly into a role in the workforce (e.g - philosophy). I actually think this is a class thing rather than anything else, private schools tend to nurture independent thought, because they're training the children of the elite to be the future leaders of the country. I wouldn't say it's a gender thing, since of course boys suffer too from this.

I don't know what state you're in, but in Indiana you're flagged with the BMV if you have a license to carry.  newlinechar  newlinechar Here, they can tell just by running your plates. I know some other states do this as well. Not sure which ones though. 	I'm in the ASU area, so I'm a bit shocked by this as I've been stopped by motorcycle cops before without incident, this is the first cruiser to stop me since the first interaction with police.

Do we know for certain that ABUniverse were selling products made by Quality Diapers? Or were they just selling the same diaper from a supplier? newlinechar  newlinechar What I mean is, was ABUniverse paying Quality Diapers in any way, or were they just selling the same product from a different source? newlinechar  newlinechar Do we really know the situation there for sure before we cast judgement?	Why would Quality Diapers give permission to use their picture if ABU was a competitor with the same product? That's extremely poor business sense. newlinechar  newlinechar And like I said, ABU has a past record with affiliating with pedophilic sites as long as they get paid. So no, we don't have a confession, but we have enough reasonable evidence to believe that they were dealing together. That they never made a statement saying they weren't is also pretty good proof. I'm sure if they weren't working together, that would have been one of the first things to come out, along with an apology. Instead, they just pretend it never happened.
Nice man!!! We expect an obligatory panorama photo of the track! :P	I have more than a few... And a picture of the fine little mama in front of me with some HUGE tits

My daughter and I were out for a bike ride on a very hot day. Stopped for a break, a old lady and her cute little doggy approached us. My daughter (whom loves animals) put her hand out gently to pet the dog. The dog cringed and bowed, even turned away from her touch. The old lady gently took my daughters hand and said 'Let her smell you first. I don't know why she does this, no one has ever abused her she is just skittish.' So my daughter let the pup smell her, flattened her hand and gently tried to stroke her back. Dog backed away still. My daughter was very confused thinking she was doing something wrong and the lady explained 'I've had her since she was a pup. I don't know why she does that.' Point is dogs have personality's and weird quirks just like humans do, it doesn't mean the owner is abusive. Knowledge before accusations.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: lots of things :)	agree some dogs are just super submissive

If you load up on pid's you don't really need to lift heavy to see results 	Also true, but again let's not generalize the details. Dorian Yates is a heavy lifter and also uses gear... so what gives? It really comes down to what someone wants to be - a body builder or a power lifter. Remember, different people respond to different style of lifting.     newlinechar     The only consistent factor, again quoting Dr. Layne Norton (from videos on metabolic damage), is **total volume.** (reps * weight = volume, so either high reps low weight or high weight low reps). Another example is the Kroc Row... 200lbs * 25 reps (1 set). If that doesn't makes you wonder what exercising muscle really means, I don't know what will.
Well, the Gilneans specifically. They were actually befriended by the night elves; the night elf druids (druids == shapeshifters in WoW) helped the Gilneans cope with their lycanthrop, mastering the beast within and gaining control over their shapeshifting. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the horde and alliance are no more good or evil than cold war-era Russia and USA. The orcs that came through the dark portal were tainted with demon blood; the orcs that formed the horde have cleansed themselves of the demon blood and distanced themselves from the atrocities of their ancestors (mostly...).	After the Scourge, it would have been difficult to see the Forsaken as anything but zombies.  I get that, but the Forsaken are not known to forget [or forgive.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FO0ejHT3tE) *spoiler alert*  The alli had their chance, now they are against us and we will crush them.

How so?	much more stringent rules, more corporate inspections. In a franchise the owner decides how hard to be on the managers who decide how hard to be on the employees whereas in a corporate store everyone is held to a relatively high standard with much less room for compassion 
The man was shooting into a crowd, killed 4 people and had a fifth hostage.  The only way a hostage taker doesn't deserve to be shot is if they haven't killed anyone yet.  He deserved it.	Well, things get tricky when the assailant is of unsound mind. Shooting him was justified because it in all likelihood prevented several other deaths. But to say that he *deserved* it when he was severely schizophrenic etc. â¦ I would have to disagree.

Syria itself had it's water work projects bombed some time earlier.

The husband and I were on the way home from an OB appointment when I was pregnant, sitting at a red light, when we saw a car coming at us through the intersection, head on. You could tell the woman was violently thrashing and seizing. My husband just sat there and watched her, while her car continues to roll over a sign, through the intersection and right at us. He was just dazed. I was screaming at him to drive, to move, go, now! My hand was on the door, ready to get my unborn baby out of the car, stat, when he finally, *finally* shifted the car into drive (it had been in park, too!) and barely got us out of the way. Unfortunately, the seizing driver hit the car right behind us, who must have had quite a shock because they couldn't see over us to see the car coming.  newlinechar  newlinechar To this day, when I demand an explanation for his delay, he replies, 'I was trying to figure out what was going on.' He must be missing the matrix panic gene or something. Mine was in full throttle. 	I  would want an explanation for the car being in park.

You dont know hes not a dog.

I know this because it was my dog who took the picture. He told me the other dog was computer illiterate and clueless. We had a pretty big laugh about the whole thing. Sorry.
What a dumb twat. If it was a choice I'd be straight so I could have a family and a non-hate filled life. 	No kidding.

What is wrong with that? Except sagas I keep my books organized by color, they are so much easier to find.	If you have a lot of books, it can make them hard to find.  I married a librarian and we have a ton of books. I can't imagine trying to find something specific if they were arranged by color. 
I'll have to try this, I suppose. My issue with DS games on the 3DS XL is that they just look *so* pixelated. Maybe it also has a little something to do with the fact that I was playing *Mario Kart 7* before I switched to *Mario Kart DS*, and even though I remembered *MKDS* looking pretty good, it just looked awful. Maybe it's just that I need to realign my expectations again.	Yeah, holding Start while starting the games should fix that. It causes the games to not be stretched to the screen size, but instead look pixel for pixel the same as they would on a DS/DSLite. They're smaller on the screen due to that, of course, since the 3DS resolution is higher, but you don't get the horrible stretching and ugliness.
He would decide to do some chores, one of which was to skim the pool. He'd do it, forget he did it, and go to do it again. He'd then get confused and frustrated because he 'knew' it needed done (originally it did), but couldn't remember doing it. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing you never knew anybody with Alzheimer's or dementia.

I will say my family has lived in South Park/Golden Hill area for over 20 years and I can't remember a single summer with whole weeks above 85f and multiple days where it is well into the 90s.

Diamond prices fluctuate **considerably**, depending on the carat, clarity and colour. For a large, nice diamond, some people pay a lot.

That's debatable.	I see your point.
If he's signed a contract, he'll lose the deposit unless the sellers are really nice people.  Been in the industry, seen it happen, A LOT.  	Depends on the contract he signed.  I know I was able to get my deposit back after an inspection turned up issues I didn't want to deal with - but I had made absolutely certain the contract had such an option before I signed it.  It really wasn't that the people were nice, either - they were actually quite unhappy that we pulled out.  But the contract was pretty clear.
Fuck, bro.  You're a culinary daredevil.  Might want to wear helmet with that shit.	A helmet might be much.

If anything; the Syrian conflict has less to do with the US and her interests than the Iraqi War does. The only reason the US would get involved would be PURELY moral reasons and if that's the case then it should be a joint UN decision, not the US playing World Police. 	You may be right about the balance of interests between the two conflicts. newlinechar  newlinechar However, there may be reasons to get involved in Syria other than moral. (From the perspective of the US government).  newlinechar  newlinechar For example, we say we don't want chemical weapons used in warfare. Then a country uses them. So we bomb them to send a message that we are powerful and we mean what we say. Other countries take note, we don't mess around.  newlinechar  newlinechar From such a perspective, it would help our cause to have UN approval, but it is not necessary. In fact, were the UN to determine that intervention were not appropriate, it would make us look weak if that appeared to affect our decision. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously I'm not saying this is what I think, in fact I find this approach reprehensible. But at the top levels of the Pentagon they see things differently.  newlinechar  newlinechar edit: The administration will of course sell any action as humanitarian intervention, but I wouldn't buy it. It would be the first time in history that any State made a decision based on principle rather than expediency. Not likely.

Google doesn't really put out an iTunes-like media syncing tool even on Windows. The 'Google Way' is to put your files in their cloud, then use the Google Android apps to get seamless access to your files from the cloud. newlinechar  newlinechar Eg with music. On your desktop you tell Google Media Manager where your files are, and it everything to the Google Cloud. Then you have access to your music from any computer via http://music.google.com or your Android phone via the Google Play Music app. newlinechar  newlinechar That's the 'Google Way' of doing things, and the tools for that are available on Linux. If you really prefer an iTunes style app, you may not find something that does everything like iTunes does, but there are music managers and photo managers that support mtp.	so you're paying a lot for streaming data, then, I take it? does one store music locally at all?

That's my problem. Step 3. I place it in the folder, I go into the game, I open 'resource packs' and all I see is 'Default' 	Alright, let's run through it, go to your .zip/folder, open it, if it says 'assets' and 'pack', than it should show up, if it just says the name of the pack, you have to take out the contents, so pull out the base file with the texture folder, and put that in your resource folder.

I think you need to realise that it was quite unique. Ki's character is a helper of all. She saw a friend in distress and helped him.

Ki's character grew quite a lot during this season and I am quite impressed with what the team produced. GG Rocketjump, GG WP.	Of course, I understand this, and this thread isn't about Ki being portrayed as the helping hand of VGHS, but rather the plot device that was used to bring that forward.

Skiing in Italy? I'm jealous! Sounds like a crazy time was had.	Yeah, at a place called Folgarida. It was pretty crazy, some of the better years of my teen life. When I said 'bring me some cunts'n'dicks' it wasn't the only stupid thing I did, my friends and I made up a game where in the shops we'd speak our own random gibberish language but pretend that it was an actual language. But that wasn't all. In this made up language we'd slip curses in every now and then eg: 'Pangyihwa kanst bi fuck itszi on kitre vagcunt'. Damn was I immature XD But it was still funny to see the looks other English folk gave us. A Canadian group once went 'HEY! We know what you're saying, idiots!' and we just laughed and left the shop. Another time a friend of mine that couldn't eat gluten went and bought a pizza from the pizza shop (he had specially made food) because the pizza the hotel gave him had bread about 4 inches thick with no cheese on and a whole tomato in the middle. He shat a lot that night. newlinechar  newlinechar The cherry on the cake was on the night before the last. Now the mountains of northern Italy are renowned for having bears habit them. We couldn't use one of the main ski slopes due to bears, there were signs all over the place. Now to us simple English people, wild bears are like a dream come true, but we didn't expect to see them. So on this night I'm walking down the hallway with 3 friends to hear someone screaming 'GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE NOW' . newlinechar  newlinechar Quick back story: That particular rooms door was jarred shut because it was locked. It had broken because a friend had broken it a previous day by ramming the lock in because the door was jammed. This friend was an idiot and that situation could have been avoided. So basically the dude in the room screaming was trapped inside. newlinechar  newlinechar I recognize the voice and yell back 'what's going on?'. His reply? 'THERE IS A FUCKING BEAR OUTSIDE AND I CAN'T GET OUT!'. So, a friend is scared shitless because there is apparently a bear outside and one way or another the only way this door is gonna open now is through sheer force. 'Kick it Bearsinky' says a friend. *kick* *kick* *smash*, the door was open after some hard pounds from my boot. I'd luckily read on some random post on Facebook the night before about how to kick open a door correctly. it's something like: Stand straight and lean back into your kick, bend your knee slightly so that your foot impacts directly next to where the lock is. Good advice. And so we burst into the room and if my eyes have ever lit up, it was at the moment when I saw the last moments of a brown bear sinking away into the snow, returning to its territory I guess, and disappearing away. And that is the untold story of how I got my username, because it was a running joke that my kicks had made the bear sink into the snow in fear.  newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry if that's a randomly long read, there were many more shenanigans but none as interesting in my eyes as the ones I put there. One of the greatest weeks of my life! newlinechar  newlinechar edit: I also knocked an electronic door out of place while being chased by a friend, it was easily fixed thank the heavens!

Can someone ELI5 what a 'network operator' is? Or in this case, who?	The 'last-mile' infrastructure, the lines that actually go into your house, in a lot of places is owned by the big Telecoms: Bell owns the phone (DSL) lines, Rogers/Shaw/Cogeco/etc. own the cable lines. newlinechar  newlinechar The CRTC has ruled that they have to provide access to these lines to competition like TekSavvy. They run their own 'back-end' so to speak (all the equipment in a headend/datacenter), and then lease that last mile from the telco to actually offer the service to your house. These are the 'network operators'. Bell et al are also network operators, but since they own the infrastructure they don't have to lease it from anyone. TS and such do, and hence they get that different label. newlinechar  newlinechar What this means is that you DO have choice in your ISP, it's just not choice in who *owns* the links from your house to the headend.
Don't have anything there though. Do you get one for playing M12? I got the award unlocked in the gridiron club. I also randomly got an RGIII card, is this it?	Nope random RG3 is a card that they gave to all teams so most users will be just doing option/running QB plays now.

All they have to do is take some notes from Assassin's Creed's fighting depth and they'll have a gem. Two-handed swords, war hammers, dual swords, daggers, spears, picking up enemy enemy weapons, hand-to-hand... so much possibility, but it looks like it's just one sword, one shield, and occasionally throwing spears.	Yeah I think they need some rpg elements, either through a more diverse weapon system as you mentioned, or unlocking flourishes, special traits, enhancing NPC team skills, etc. I hope they didn't make it too realistic where theres none of that stuff. They did hint that the QTE gets you more points. Maybe spending points on stuff is what makes the combat more interesting. I hope they reveal more soon. Good thing I'm a digital download only guy, where I can make this decision when I get my xbox :D.

This.  I eat vegan almost all the time and always check the menu before I go somewhere.  It's not the Chef's job to go off menu because of your life choice.  And the Vegan certainly shouldn't complain about there being nothing for them, no one forced you to go to that restaurant. 	Thank you! I used to work at a place that was known for its prime rib.

What does being scum bags have to do with it? I don't see the Qunari as scum bags at all, and that has nothing to do with why they don't work well as the PC. newlinechar  newlinechar If the lead writer behind the game and the lore of Qunari has said before he doesn't think they fit with being a PC or Romance option based on what hes writen, and has now changed that, I think thats telling about the situation. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not judging entirely yet, but I am now skeptical about the game more that I was before.

Just before he tweeted a pic of him as pantheon with his foot on 3 clg member's faces. Scarra is an asshole but he hides it well. Nien just made a prediction like everyone else and suddenly he's an asshole lol
She was my first love ^ __ ^ newlinechar  newlinechar We met online. I used to run a website, and she was a big fan of mine. Eventually we got to talking, chatting on AIM, and discovered we had a bit of an interest in one another. She was a much older woman, and I was a young, sexy teenager. It started as an emotional affair. We talked for hours at a time. Her husband was, to say the least, a dick. I gave her the respect and care she didn't receive at home. I honestly didn't think I'd ever meet her, let alone fall in love the way I did. newlinechar  newlinechar Eventually the opportunity arose to meet face to face. Something we hadn't been able to do since we lived on opposite ends of the country. This was nerve racking for a lot of reasons. She was a married woman, with kids. I didn't even have a part time job. Nonetheless, we were determined. I used the resources I had to manipulate my time and arrange some extended 'free periods' away from family and friends. newlinechar  newlinechar Then I met her. It was in the game room of a hotel I was staying at. She traveled so far, just to see me. I honestly didn't know how I felt about that. She was so sweet, with a lovely smile. I definitely didn't feel like I deserved her. She was a wonderful woman, who to this day I've never met an equal. newlinechar  newlinechar I remember every minute of that day. Our first hug. Shooting pool. Holding a door open for her. Walking in front of her just in case she tripped going down the stairs. Then we kissed, the first time I'd kissed anyone. Then we made love. newlinechar  newlinechar Incidentally that 'oh shit' moment I described came almost two years later. I can't think of a time in my life that wasn't filled with happiness, just by having her around. I still feel guilty about it. Not because it started life as an affair, but guilty because I knew a happiness very few will ever experience. It almost seems selfish to be that happy with someone. newlinechar  newlinechar I could go on, if people are interested. This was only part of a 4 year journey. There is a lot to this story.	Oh dear, ugh. You could write sappy romance if you wanted. Half expected a loch ness monster to show up.

Mindblowing stuff.
Considering 2 C9 members were diving at low health, I'd say ANY extra damage would have made the difference...	I was waiting for someone to make this.  I was just sitting there staring at Patoy.  
I'm familiar. It's exactly what my kid would have, if they were lucky.	I just looked at the website and now the things have screens and ringtone options. I liked the old ones with no screen. IMO it's what any kids under 12 need, not an iphone. 
We're past it now.  I just very purposefully don't speak to her about any personal matters.  We have very different world views and that's just something we need to accept about each other, even if we'll never agree.	:( I find it sad when especially parents and siblings and close friends can't agree to live and let live, and agree to disagree and be more accepting.
&gt; Internal sources   newlinechar  newlinechar Fuck that shit...	Internal sources i.e. sources that we can't tell you about i.e. there are no sources i.e. I just made it up.
The characters do appear in normal gameplay but with the figures you can access them earlier on.	Yeah. I was just saying you can download the game and play it without the figures. Unless you mean Skylanders, in which case I have no idea as I've never played the game.
I grew up in a very small Oklahoma town.   newlinechar  newlinechar While I did many things that most more urban people would see as redneck activities both as a kid and adult, I was still pretty citified compared to the farming, ranching, tobacco-chewing honkies I came up with.  Also, EVERYBODY played most sports and football.  I didn't.   newlinechar  newlinechar So, relative to those guys, I may as well have been Liberace.  But compared to most people outside that small world, I'm pretty masculine, including when compared to most straight guys.  And ESPECIALLY when I see these straight-but-emo-looking metrosexual guys that are in their 20s now.  It was a weird realization to finally have, but I'm sure it's why I seldom ping much on people's gaydar unless they're my age or older.  I can't tell you the number of younger people that were absolutely floored to find out I'm gay.  newlinechar  newlinechar As I mentioned, if I'm with someone, they're (hopefully) smart.  I enjoy being able to consider things with someone I respect.  It isn't that I don't like making decisions, it's that I like and prefer to have a sounding board and second opinion that I can trust.	Ohhh, okay that makes a lot of sense now.  Feminine relative only to your upbringing and limited pool of data.  Ahahaha, oh metros~ Interesting. I had never had someone explain liking smartness for that reason, and yet I myself like having sounding boards as well...  my brain is special -.-; newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, ty for the clarity! newlinechar 
I don't agree with that. Dyrus has consistantly played Rumble very well throughout both splits, he's gotten better yes, but he's always been one of the biggest proponents of Rumble.	He tweeted he wasn't going to play rumble anymore after he lost post nerf, and he didn't. Then allstars, then suddenly more rumble play.  he has been consistent player but its still true.

Can i ask what fps you get from this?	Around 30. Some places are better or worse, but it's pretty consistent and never hinders my playing (YMMV; I know 30 can be unbearable for some people) newlinechar  newlinechar *The ENB is what really drops the framerate to the high 20s/low 30s.

I prefer the 'I'll stick my hand in your cage and let you approach me at your own pace' socialization. Just do it multiple times a day. Give them treats if they'll take it. Everyone has their own method. Leave a t-shirt that you've worn all day inside the cage too. Helps them get used to your scent. newlinechar  newlinechar If they're overweight a diet switch like you've done may help. Hold off on peanuts those are VERY fatty. Try using cheerios as treats. Much better option, especially for them being overweight. You can mix it up with apple/cinnamon cheerios, honey cheerios, standard, etc. IMO I would let them have access to oxbow 24/7 and keep giving them veggies and monitor their weight before you make any drastic changes. newlinechar  newlinechar Just a normal rat thing. They'll cuddle sometimes, be separate sometimes, 2 will be cuddling and 1 will be off on her own. newlinechar  newlinechar In regards to the girls thin hair and dandruff, see if you can stroke her back. If it falls off its dandruff and some olive oil can help moisturize her skin. If it doesn't fall off it could be lice.	This is great advice, thank you! I did that for a bit, I sat in front of the cage and they came up and sniffed me, I gave them my hand and they put their paws on it and smelled me, sometimes nibbling on my fingertips, which still makes me a little apprehensive. Not maliciously, it's almost like they're testing the texture of my finger with their teeth. It never hurts, but feeling teeth on me all of a sudden surprises me. Then one girl climbed up the door onto the top and couldn't seem to get back down, so when I picked her up, she seemed much more comfortable. She held on for a second, but she didn't wriggle, or latch onto my hands like the did yesterday. And tomorrow I'll wear a shirt I don't care for much, and throw it in there afterwards. newlinechar  newlinechar As for their weight, they seem to like carrots and broccoli, which I'll continue to give them. Frozen blueberries seem to be a favorite too, but I know those are high in sugar. I don't have any Cheerios, so will unfrosted shredded wheat squares be ok? newlinechar  newlinechar I tried stroking my one girls back to see if it would flake off or not, and it was hard to tell. It seemed to come off her, but it blended in with my skin enough that I couldn't see. They seem to scratch themselves fairly often, but that could just be grooming, because they wash their faces a lot. newlinechar  newlinechar Thank you so much for all of the advice, it's really helpful. I'm so glad I found this subreddit.

Not to mention the two actions happened far away from each other in terms of space. It was clear simulation and that shit needs to be punished... instead we get this shit. Fucking hell.

Glad to hear about the changes, however dunking seems to be overvalued, while rebounding appears to be undervalued.  Everything else, however, seems great! newlinechar  newlinechar Just my unqualified opinion though.	I agree, this is just what the regression told me. It could be that linear regression is not the best way to look at the data, or it could be that the current game simulation code overvalues/undervalues certain things.
How is he arrogant to take the chances that are given to him? He is getting signed to play for NFL teams so he would be an idiot to say no.	'Oh, you're gonna give me a shot at being a backup QB? No thanks, I don't deserve it. I think I'm gonna just go on unemployment for a bit.'
I have lost count of how many games we've lost because of missed field goals.	Like, there's seriously no one on the soccer team who we could recruit to do it better? I mean, I know that was a long fieldgoal try, but he wasn't even close...
I think the way they did it in rome 1 was suffecient. They can be recruited anywhere but they also name them as to acknowledge that they are not from there. i.e iberian infantry	Though the Carthaginian military didn't ever really have a constant type of unit wherever they went besides maybe a few units from Carthage but that was it. For the most part their military was comprised of units that were not constant wherever they went. An example would be in Sicily the Carthaginian army was made of Greek-like spearmen and warriors commonly found in the Sicilian area. Where as in Gaul the Carthaginian army was mainly composed of barbarian swordsmen and cavalry.

There are many instances of your point on power being used throughout the show, from Luffy's gear 3rd not chibi-ing him anymore to Law having a larger room. However, that's still just a matter of scale. Except for that one instance, we really haven't seen anything that definitively show a mastery over your element outside of yourself. I've seen a lot of people in this thread put forward examples, but none of them are nearly as concrete as the very specific line you've dug up.  newlinechar  newlinechar To your next point, I've seen this a few times in this thread. I like this from a literary point of view. I really do. But they simply don't say that. They just say that he's been doing experiments, and I always took that to mean that he's changing into different gases to see how they work on normal humans. If they had a conversation about that in particular, I'd say great. If they started drawing parallels between his work and the Rumble balls, I'd be over the moon. I suppose I should just read between the lines here. Heck, his work does specifically deal with DF's. It just doesn't seem like Oda's style, and it doesn't seem like a fruit that  compares well to others that we've seen.	BTW, I just checked the thing about Enel, in the translation [here](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/4884/one-piece_ch278_by_null/2) it says he's creating these electrical waves. But in the official Viz Manga it says he can sense them with his ability just like how Crocodile can sense the sand in the desert. newlinechar  newlinechar After some thought, I guess you're right about Logia users not being able to control stuff that didn't come from them. Unless there is physical contact or a link between them.  newlinechar  newlinechar Crocodile can't just flip his wrist and sand will erupt from a far. but he has to touch the ground in order to control the sand around him. Ace can't make a fire rise from a distance, but he'll be able to control it once he touches it. Enel won't be able to control the electrical signals  inside your body unless he touches you. If I go by this logic, then CC controlling the oxygen around him makes perfect sense. Cause it's everywhere and he's constantly making physical touche with the air. That's why he can take it away, just like how Crocodile can take away the moisture out of everything when he touches them.    newlinechar  newlinechar How about this explanation? It certainly changed my view just now, and I understand Logias better. I hope it convinces you too.

I can judge based on the fact I have seen a bazillion non autistic kids run away from their parents.	There are autistics that will run, it's part of their neurology.  There are neurotypicals children who run too but they can be taught different behaviors over time.  Some autistics can't ever override the fight/flight response.  Although there are lazy parents using leashes inappropriately, a leash is a reasonable choice for a good parent who is out of options to keep their child safe.  If the child is looks cared for, content and not bothered by the leash then it may be best to leave your judgements to your own parenting.

I think not vaccinating your kids is stupid. But if old diseases resurface, shouldn't the vaccinated people be safe? It's only going to knock out those who chose not to vaccinated. Then it will die out again. Theoretically we should all be safe if something happens to get spread around again.  	The fear is that they are putting unvaccinated babies (who are too young to have finished their shots) and immuno suppresed (those on chemo etc.) children/people at risk of getting these diseases.  So it doesn't only hurt you and your children (and there's ethics questions there too, like how the faith healing parents went to jail but those who don't vaccinate and their kid dies of say measles don't) it can hurt all of the babies and sick people around you who aren't choosing not to vaccinate. 
Seriously, i want an explanation.	Forces are just accelerations. The source of the force does not change how it is applied (gravity, magnetism, nuclear, or just a person pushing/pulling something), so in the plane, if it accelerates towards the earth faster than the acceleration due to gravity, everything inside will tend towards a direction 'down' inside the cock-pit, or away from the earth (since the plane is inverted).

Unless you need to deal with objects very close to the camera, you don't need to do anything but focus on infinity and stop down. newlinechar  newlinechar With wider lenses, usually focus on infinity and stop down to f/8 or f/11 is enough to get the scene in focus well, and makes the horizon/sky line cleaner. newlinechar  newlinechar With very close focus, use Live view and DoF preview to adjust for focus at the closest point in the scene that you need in sharp focus, and check the horizon line or furthest point. newlinechar  newlinechar The latter option works well when using longer lenses with closer objects in the scene as well.	I have to disagree with this technique. I started using mirrorless and live-view zoom to confirm both infinity and close focus, but with growing experience, started to simply dial in the focus for the given aperture and found this to be equally effective. I haven't missed focus on a landscape shot in a long time. newlinechar  newlinechar The issue with focusing on infinity rather than splitting the difference is that you have to open the aperture beyond wha'ts needed at hyperfocal distance. My lenses are quite sharp enough that diffraction is an issue at f5.6.

That really just boils down to 'well I don't want Mr. Kadhr to be charged with treason due to extenuating circumstances even though by definition his actions were treason'. newlinechar  newlinechar That's soft-headed reasoning because those circumstances are something on considers in *sentencing*.  They don't change his citizenship, (no matter how much the anti-Kadhr folks might it wish so) and they don't change his actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Mr. Kadhr is either a Canadian citizen or he is not.  If he is not, then the US should drop him off back in Afghanistan and let them deal with him. newlinechar  newlinechar But of course that's a problem, (and any advocate for Mr. Kadhr will say it is), because Mr. Kadhr *is* a Canadian citizen.  That means that by fighting against Canada he committed treason. newlinechar  newlinechar His age, his nasty family, and his time spent outside Canada are all factors when considering appropriate punishments, (not to mention his time already spent in prison), but they don't change his citizenship and they don't change who he was fighting against.	It is for more than just sentencing, but for determining guilt in the first place. Why? Because according to Canadian law, he would have to be charged under the legislation of the day when he committed the crime, which means using the now defunct Young Offenders Act.  newlinechar  newlinechar Using that, his case would probably be thrown out because of the lack of evidence, and the many violations during his time at Bagram and Gitmo. newlinechar  newlinechar However, even if the court did somehow manage to convict him, they would definitely have to let him go for time served, as the maximum sentencing in the YOA was 10 years.

As happened with libya, Russia and China were ''fooled'' in a way to authorizing UNSC force. I expect whatever 'limited' or 'surgical' strikes to do more than whatever they say they will. As for another false flag, do you think they'll do another one or is the aug 21 the one they'll settle with?	They'll do the strike and then assess the damage to his assets and provide intel to where they rebels should target weaknesses. If it goes wrong again, they can pull another false flag for round 2. Watch what happens after the first strike very closely and you will see the change in attitude if it doesn't go right.

Keenum and Yates both made the team as well.  Wondering if they are actually going to keep both or explore trade options.	Reading all the training camp interviews, Kubes really loved the QB competition we had going for that spot. I don't think it would be a terrible stretch if, barring contract restructuring, a superbowl, or schaub just lighting on fire (like 2009 Schaub), we let Schaub go after 2014/2015 rather than taking the $17/19 million cap hits he'll cost us in 2015/2016 (respectively).

I'll repeat myself: newlinechar  newlinechar The Church supports the use of very real police violence against women if they dare attempt the 'wrong' type of reproductive medical care. This leads to women dying due to unsafe underground procedures. That is not 'peaceful!' Church members give financial and social support for these actions. Church control over education and the family leads to generational perpetuation of obsequiousness and ignorance. Historically anarchists saw religion, Catholicism in particular, as the foundation on which the state and capital are built. newlinechar  newlinechar It really is a shame. There is a growing global atheist movement going on right now. Read any serious anarchist writing before the 1970s, at least any writing coming out of organized anarchist movements, and you would assume that anarchists would be at the forefront of 'new atheism', yet because of post-modernist abandonment of rationalism/empiricism and embrace of liberal multiculturalism and identity politics and a turn away from class struggle, we are nowhere to be seen. newlinechar 	Thanks for this reply!

Of course they are, however, the statistics don't lie.  In 2012, pit bulls accounted for 61% of all fatal attacks despite being less than 5% of the total dog population.  From 2005 - 2012, pit bulls killed one American citizen every 19 days.  Pit Bulls were cruelly bred for generations to be aggressive so they compete and win in illegal dog fights.  I'm basing my bias against pit bulls on data.  What is ignorant is to ignore the data and statistics on these dogs.  But for the sake of argument, lets say its because of the owners.  The statistics are still the same.  	I see what you mean, I think a lot of it can be argued similar to the nature vs. nurture debate. It's clear that both factors play a role. Humans took a beautiful breed and began to sabotage it for their personal entertainment. Statistics are good for hindsight, but each individual dog deserves it's own chance before it's labeled a killer.

I said transportation energy. The liquid fuel economic infrastructure (in the transportation of goods sense, which is a fundamental backbone of economy) in many ways predates modern electrical infrastructure. We have close to 1,000,000,000 internal combustion engines in the world. And we have absolutely no way to supplement or fix the incoming liquid fuels shortages. Like I said, 98% of liquid fuels are petroleum-based. And not only the fuels. All the plastics, composites, fertilizers, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, etc. They're all made from petroleum. newlinechar  newlinechar Hell, one *mile* of a typical municipal road can take 100,000 gallons of oil to pave.  newlinechar  newlinechar Electricity, no matter where it comes from, is a considerably small part of the economy. Beyond powering information systems, household life, utilities, and some components of production-side infrastructure, a vast swathe of the economy is hopelessly reliant on liquid petroleum fuels, and is in no way geared to switch any time soon.  newlinechar  newlinechar Without a continuous supply of *cheap* petroleum (there will always be petroleum, we have tons of it.. the problem is we are running out of the cheap stuff, and alarmingly fast), the economy will simply fail. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: And before we go all 'Tesla', EV's, etc., will save the world!'. They won't. And they were never meant to. Tesla's are luxury vehicles, and the batteries alone cost upwards of 10,000-20,000 dollars. Just imagine what they would cost for the diesels/barges/etc that use many dozens/hundreds/thousands of gallons of fuel in one sitting. newlinechar  newlinechar Barring some miracle of science that creates an energy storage medium comparable to liquid fuels (which won't happen), I think we're in a bit of a pickle. One barrel of oil contains as much usable energy as 11 1/3 years of an average human male's labor output (equivalent to 1700 kwh). And we use close to 80 million *per day*.	And nuclear energy is supposed to fix this... how? I mean that was your initial argument here. newlinechar  newlinechar And btw there is heavy research going into fuel produced out of algea for example - which is decades away from mass production but at least it's an idea.

This has veered wildly off topic from OP's question, but it's generating some interesting discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't give a shit about saluting until about a year ago when I was reading up on how the MACP got started.  I'm going to fuck up the quote that stuck with me, but it was something about 'it's not the techniques learned in combatives that matters, but the warfighting qualities that it fosters in its participants.'  Saluting, to me, has become a part of the big picture of 'shit that you do in the army to demonstrate that you know what the fuck you're doing as a soldier.'   newlinechar  newlinechar I know that the Warrant Officer rank structure is weird to 98% of the army, but I also remember the easy button back when I was a junior enlisted infantry guy of 'non-enlisted rank = salute'.  When I get gawked at and passed up by an E-2, not a big deal.  I feel kind of bad that his first line supervisor isn't setting him up for success, but it's a failure on the part of his trainers more-so than the soldier.  If a goddamn E-5 makes eye contact with me coming out of goddamn, Starbucks, then tilts her head down so as to 'not notice me' as we're passing 18' from one another on the sidewalk, I *might* yell 'BACKBONE OF THE ARMY' after her as she's getting in her goddamn GSA van.  All bets are off if I'm with one of the CW4s that molded me into an individual that metabolizes suffering and ejaculates victory.  I will not suffer the lazy or ill informed enlisted soldier to ignore someone that's been an officer since I was in grade school.  I'm not sure if that, amongst the other things, makes me an asshole, but it's what's been working for me.	Nail on head, brother. newlinechar I think it comes from both of us being enlisted and NCOs. It's one thing to make a mistake, it's another to be downright wrong. As I told one NCO who stated to a junior enlisted they didn't have to salute a 2LT because they haven't earned it yet, if you don't like where you are, go get your degree and apply to OCS, or try and make it through WO training. (Not to mention as a 2LT in 1998 I'd deployed to Somalia, Haiti (well, sort of a deployment) and Bosnia and had a CIB, AASLT, jump wings and my RLTW hooah tab.)  newlinechar  newlinechar I, as well, am much more likely to jump someone's shit if I'm walking with a CW3/CW4/CW5 (someone who clearly has 'been there done that') and I see a Soldier walk by and blatantly turn their head away pretending not to see. But I've more frequently jumped the shit of an officer that returned a salute with one of those half-assed wave at the eyes crap. It goes both ways.

It's a dotted line, meaning passing is acceptable. newlinechar  newlinechar And a turning light only shuts off when you turn it off or when you turn the wheel a significant amount in the opposite direction, so no, Blue didn't signal.

The first time I read your post it came off as if it wasn't really a priority for you to find it. I didn't realize you put an honest effort into finding it.

He's been there every time I come in (works almost every day) and I was telling him about it the last two times I went in.  Out of our two conversations I had told him personally that I had gone through my car (which I was sure it would be there in the first place), my room repeatedly, including moving my bed to make sure it couldn't have made it anywhere under there.  I even checked all the kitchen drawers and the pantry and other places that made no sense. newlinechar  newlinechar The only reason I don't think I threw it away is because I have no memory of doing so and the battery was still good so I would have probably used it for a battery in the future.  Honestly, I'm a bit flabbergasted that I still haven't found it.  I told him all this and I think the shocking/weird part of it all is that he had the attitude of 'well, I guess it's gone.'  I knew it sucked I couldn't get it to them, but I didn't know there was a problem until today.

This is something Montecristo mentioned in his Grilled interview and elsewhere. Korean players don't have this type of security. Teams don't keep players because they're popular or get a lot of stream viewers, if you underperform, you get replaced. It's not the replacing that makes teams so good, it's the threat of losing your job that keeps the fire under their asses to perform well.	Exactly, I mentioned this because I recently watched Monte's Grilled and it really made me respect him and what he does even more, one of the most insightful interviews I've seen. Everybody should actually take a look at it, [here's the link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfDKae7JgG0). It's 2 hours long, but man is it worth the time.

Hey, sort-of-cis sort-of-genderqueer person drive-by commenting here. newlinechar  newlinechar I was flipping from subreddit to subreddit and saw your post, and I just want to say: growing breasts can be a mindfuck.

From stargate wiki: newlinechar  newlinechar The Goa'uld first arose in the waters of P3X-888, originally as predators. Eventually, they began taking the native Unas as hosts, becoming more adaptive. They eventually learned how to operate the Stargate the Ancients placed on P3X-888 and left, taking Unas slave armies with them. (SG1: 'The First Ones') newlinechar  newlinechar Under the leadership of Atok, the Goa'uld developed the first of their society as conquerors, stealing Ancient technology and adapting it to their purposes. In 22,000 BC, Atok was killed by his son Apep, and he reordered the leadership of the Goa'uld. Apep shared power among his underlings, Ra, Nut, and Thoth. However, around 17,800 BC, another Goa'uld began to rise in power: Anubis. Apep's powers began to decline in this time, and Anubis gained more power. Anubis then killed Apep, devouring the symbiote before the eyes of the Goa'uld. However, Ra managed to rally the others in Apep's name. After three centuries of civil war, Anubis was defeated and exiled. Ra organized a new leadership called the High Council of the System Lords. Ra installed himself as the Supreme System Lord of the Goa'uld Empire, and took the Goa'uld Queens Hathor and Egeria as mates. (RPG: 'Living Gods: Stargate System Lords') newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So it seems like they originally dominated on the backs of the unas armies and hosts. Genetic memory gave them an advantage over other species and so they would have been able to steal technology from any civilisations with advanced technology (at the time that could include the Nox, Furlings, the occasional Ancient or Asgard and whatever other races we don't know about). For example it is known Ra took the Asgard Casimir as a host for a short time, so it's not too much of a stretch to guess that maybe they stole some early Asgard stuff.	The weird thing about that story is that Apep is another name for Apophis. newlinechar  newlinechar Doesn't seem to fit...

&gt; As for the 'reason' people are atheists, it does annoy me when people bring this up out of nowhere. They haven't polled atheists.  newlinechar  newlinechar This has been surveyed.  If I recall correctly, the number one reason people were leaving Catholicism was because of their extreme policies against homosexuality, abortion, and birth control which accounted for about half of the de-conversions.  The conflict between science and religion did get mention, but I think it was around 10% or so.  So, yes, some people are leaving religion because of science, but it only accounts for a small percentage. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: [Looked it up.](http://www.pewforum.org/2009/04/27/faith-in-flux2/) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In contrast to opinions on these questions, majorities of those who have become unaffiliated disagree with the idea that science proves religion is just superstition. Only 32% of former Catholics and the same percentage of former Protestants agree that science proves religion to be superstition, and fewer still (less than a quarter) say it was important in their conversion.	Sorry, I meant the people who tend to say this to me haven't polled atheists, or read these studies. I'm aware there have been lots of polls on why people leave their faith, and they almost always tend to be because the religion they were in was doing things they considered immoral. newlinechar  newlinechar I usually hear, with this argument, that people are atheists because something bad happened to them, so they turned their back on god. It's almost always about atheists not understanding the religion properly, instead of finding something they disagree with, whether it be morals or science or a million other things.

My pleasure. Don't be intimidated by the exam. As a general rule, the SAT II is easier than the corresponding AP exam, so you'll be fine on the SAT II if you did well on AP Physics B. That being said, even if you didn't do well on the exam you can still pull a good score on the SAT II.  newlinechar  newlinechar Don't underestimate math II, though; in my experience, that one takes a respectable amount of review if you want a good score. 	I got a 3 on the AP exam...which I don't know how to feel about. (In other words, I'm not sure if I was confident in my ability to get a 4.) How should I expect that to translate on the SAT Physics test? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also not confident in my understanding of Optics, Electromagnetism, and Modern Physics.

I'm guessing that the Qunari you play as is one that has converted to the faith of the Chantry, not a traditional Qunari bound by those rules.

OK, you want me to argue linearity vs. open world, I can do that. newlinechar  newlinechar Perception is important.  It's why game developers spend money on art assets, voice work, and really anything that isn't pure gameplay, including storytelling.  It's not fair to dismiss order of play as a mere 'illusion of choice,' because that kind of choice has an immense effect on the player's perception, even if the story is the same either way.  In ME and DAO, I feel like I'm playing the game *explicitly to advance the story*; I wouldn't play if there wasn't a story payoff sooner or later.  In DA2, I feel like I'm advancing the story in order to experience more gameplay; as soon as the gameplay ceases to satisfy, the game as a whole does too.	This is where it becomes a matter of opinion, I guess. I never got tired of the gameplay in DA2, always enjoyed the sidequests, and when it was time to advance the story, it felt like it. I can certainly see where you're coming from, but the experience wasn't diminished for me.

Though the Carthaginian military didn't ever really have a constant type of unit wherever they went besides maybe a few units from Carthage but that was it. For the most part their military was comprised of units that were not constant wherever they went. An example would be in Sicily the Carthaginian army was made of Greek-like spearmen and warriors commonly found in the Sicilian area. Where as in Gaul the Carthaginian army was mainly composed of barbarian swordsmen and cavalry.	I would argue though that the troops that we see like numidian  cavalry and iberian infantry were fairly consistant up till there fall so they did have consistant troops just not from carthage itself

install samba newlinechar &gt;sudo apt-get install samba newlinechar  newlinechar i dont remember the exact command... there are online guides for it. newlinechar  newlinechar anyway, it allows SMB filesharing which is how windows likes it. newlinechar  newlinechar then plug in a powered usb hub, and a few large hard drives.	I use samba with a raspi for NAS. Not particularly quick (transfer rates with a 5400 rpm HD are ~3 mbps), but has been very reliable. VLC will stream HD video with no buffering. 
The problem is, myself and many others staircase to bedrock to find diamonds. If we use this rule, nobody will be able to find diamonds unless they are in chests or if a cave above y=32 leads to diamond level.	That's the idea, you should have to take some sort of risk to get diamonds. i.e. caving. That's why strip mining isn't allowed. Stair casing is just as bad as strip mining IMO. It removes the risk.
But he keeps the comment to post ratio necessary, you don't NEED to post other's work.	&gt; Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, and it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror â you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content. newlinechar  newlinechar Comments aren't 'content'.

I understand your point - he's certainly used to living off of less than I am, but he wants to move up in life and be at a higher income level (right now he's looking for any income at all). Income is not a sign of success, but I do think I could be happier being middle-income than near the poverty level, because I like the security of it.  newlinechar  newlinechar You do make a good point though, even a rich person could become poor tomorrow - but that also means that my guy has the potential to move up and become more financially secure..  newlinechar I can wait for that a little longer - But how long is too long to wait for something like that to happen?  I've never dated anyone other than him, and I dont want to get stuck. I'll be left behind in the dating world if I wait on him too long. Especially since in my culture, people get married kind of early, and I'm already feeling some pressure to get married. He's certainly NOT marriagable as he is now though. Couldn't even afford the wedding. 	I think you might be doing him a disservice if you're only waiting on him (aka. settling) because you feel pressured to get married or think you'll be left behind in the dating world. Yes, it is possible to move up and make more money, but that can't happen overnight, whereas serious injury or a firing certainly can. Also, you two definitely need to be on the same page if you expect him to afford a wedding, and exactly what type of wedding you're referring to. You're still young and I think it would benefit you to gain some more life experience before you rush into marrying anyone just because you're pressured. Financial security does **not** equal happiness.
Oh joy, the mass downvoting..	I know. I don't care about internet points, but still...pretty unnecessary.
You're arguing with a guy who paid for a title from Sealand. I wouldn't take his opinion too seriously.	hahahahhahahahah
How is it supposed to be said? 	According to one book on classical Latin, 'ii' should have the following sound. newlinechar  newlinechar The first i is short as in the English 'hit'.  newlinechar The second is long as the i in 'machine'. newlinechar  newlinechar So denarii sounds like den-ar-i-ee, and triarii would sound like tree-ar-i-ee. Many others say it like tree-ar-ee-ee. If you're lazy you can just say tree-are-ee, like Nintendo Wii.  Download a realism mod with Latin voices (Europa Barbarorum is one), and they sound like that. If you watch Time Commanders that's how the historians say it as well.
CLG's first game was better than Vulcan's first game. Vulcan's second game was better than CLG's second game. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that sums it up a bit better. newlinechar  newlinechar Vulcan was almost perfect even with TSM 2nd game, but lost because of one small mistake of fighting at baron before mancloud could get there. Even though mancloud was late he could have cleaned up if Turtle didn't take down targets perfectly like he did. Much closer than CLG's game 2. 	It's Vulcun :(

That's pretty bad.	Same commentator just made the comment along the lines of (still about that same challenge) that it was a very smart foul by O'Rourke.  He sent a message to Dempsey and now Clint will think twice about trying to get through him for the rest of the game and will probably back off if given the opportunity to dibble at him.
When you flip the burger, won't it all just leak out?	When I said pierce a hole I meant a very small one. You can press the patty a bit to seal the hole then flip.

It actually isn't. The reason mainly is that the traditional border between Europe and Middle-east is the Strait of Bosporus and that Turkey is such a big economy (76 Million people] that it can easily start to unstabilize or such, the Union. Just look at the Mediterranean countries, Spain, Greece, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia etc. They already have big riots in Turkey few months ago. newlinechar  newlinechar But Turkey is a member of NATO...	That makes way more sense than religious intolerance. 
&gt; But given that I failed at spelling sweet a few times there, perhaps I should stop for the evening. I am expected to be slightly operational tomorrow. newlinechar  newlinechar Flippin' casual! Everybody knows 'sweet' is particularly hard to spell anyway.	My ability to type is one of the later things I lose; Probably has to do with being a compsci university student at one point... or spending an inordinate amount of time in front of a computer. newlinechar  newlinechar So... I should probably stop. But for some reason the Raspberry cider is now open. newlinechar  newlinechar [](/ajshrug)
can vouch. lived in Indiana for a couple years. came back to Illinois and everyone thought I was a redneck.	Cannot vouch. I think it depends on what part of the state you're from.  Whenever I'm in southern Indiana I notice it. Indianapolis area and north and I don't notice a thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've lived in the northern part of the state my entire life and according to friends (from all over the country) I don't have any accent.

What makes you think it's her drinking and smoking, and that she's not just holding them for someone else?	It's the logical assumption. Not to say it's definitely the case, but you don't exactly see someone holding a sandwich and think 'Oh, they must be holding that for a friend!' 
I'm not a pop music producer, but Robin Thicke's original song is the laziest, most overrated thing I've heard in a long time.

The actual issue is immaterial. We could be talking about same-sex marriage, polygamy, abortion, drug laws etc; it doesn't matter. The premise that policymakers should vote based upon their familial ties is ludicrous. 	&gt;The actual issue is immaterial. newlinechar  newlinechar No it isn't. Provided there are no moral quandaries (which their aren't) then it would be very reasonable and commonplace to support your consenting sibling's and his/her partner's values rather than violate them with draconian policies that the government has no business dabbling in anyways.  Muddying the water with red herrings that have nothing to do with the subject at hand is nothing more than pedestrian rhetorical smoke and mirrors.  Polygamous marriage and same-sex marriage are two different things.  Inter-species marriage is another thing that is quite different as well, no?   newlinechar  newlinechar Do you know what's ludicrous?  Stating that the 'the actual issue is immaterial' when the 'actual issue' is the specific subject being discussed.  That is almost as ludicrous as the red herrings that you are using to equivocate the issue.
I have no clue where I could find APC in a brick &amp; mortar store around me. I figured I was just gonna have to bite the bullet and order what I think will work then pay for the return if I have to.	A Nordstrom close to me carries them. If you've got one close, check on their in store availability. I'd always recommend trying them on before purchasing. I have been wrong on sizing before and it's bitten me in the ass.

&gt; The arabs attacked the security of Israel by means of military buildup and imminent invasion. newlinechar  newlinechar Get lost.

They'll do the strike and then assess the damage to his assets and provide intel to where they rebels should target weaknesses. If it goes wrong again, they can pull another false flag for round 2. Watch what happens after the first strike very closely and you will see the change in attitude if it doesn't go right.	Right. Don't you think Aug 21st chem attack was way too obvious of a false flag? i can't wait to see what they have up next...

[](/scootascared) Yeeeagh, that's actually worse. The anticipation absolutely kills me... newlinechar  newlinechar Pretty okay song so far, though.	But the honest emotion(in this case fear) makes it even better. especially when you start to calm down then rock out to it. In my case I like ti use their music to block stuff out when I get stressed. These songs almost take me back to the dark fantasy realms I spend so much time in, like a happy place. Yes, my happy place involves swordfighting and slaying villains and demons.

No, but the mosquito will keep up with a reaver that's trying to run away, even with a racer frame on the reaver.	Doesn't Reaver with Afterburners have a higher max speed? Either way a few KPH isn't enough for ANY ESF to outrun another ESF with A2As. They suck regardless of what faction you are on and the only option you have is to turn and fight.
No. On average you get â¬15 on your â¬20 and only about 2% of tickets are winners. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, those in the 2% win an average of nearly â¬1M. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, most lotteries in the US are $1-10.	Of course, *on average* you always get less than you paid, that's where the owners of the game get their profit from. But still, a 15% chance of 'winning or at least not losing' sounds better than most lottery games I know, hence *relatively* easy.
